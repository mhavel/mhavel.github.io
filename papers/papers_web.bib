	Abstract = {We report the discovery of two transiting exoplanets, CoRoT-25b and CoRoT-26b, both of low density, one of which is in the Saturn mass-regime. For each star, ground-based complementary observations through optical photometry and radial velocity measurements secured the planetary nature of the transiting body and allowed us to fully characterize them. For CoRoT-25b we found a planetary mass of 0.27  &plusmn; 0.04  M<sub>{Jup}</sub>, a radius of 1.08<sub>-0.10</sub><sup>+0.3</sup>  R<sub>{Jup}</sub> and hence a mean density of 0.15<sub>-0.06</sub><sup>+0.15</sup>  g cm<sup>{-3}</sup>. The planet orbits an F9 main-sequence star in a 4.86-day period, that has a V magnitude of 15.0, solar metallicity, and an age of 4.5<sub>-2.0</sub><sup>+1.8</sup>-Gyr. CoRoT-26b orbits a slightly evolved G5 star of 9.06  &plusmn; 1.5-Gyr age in a 4.20-day period that hassolar metallicity and a V magnitude of 15.8. With a mass of 0.52  &plusmn; 0.05  M<sub>{Jup}</sub>, a radius of 1.26<sub>-0.07</sub><sup>+0.13</sup>  R<sub>{Jup}</sub>, and a mean density of 0.28<sub>-0.07</sub><sup>+0.09</sup>  g cm<sup>{-3}</sup>, it belongs to the low-mass hot-Jupiter population. Planetary evolution models allowed us to estimate a core mass of a few tens of Earth mass for the two planets with heavy-element mass fractions of 0.52<sub>-0.15</sub><sup>+0.08</sup> and 0.26<sub>-0.08</sub><sup>+0.05</sup>, respectively, assuming that a small fraction of the incoming flux is dissipated at the center of the planet. In addition, these models indicate that CoRoT-26b is anomalously large compared with what standard models could account for, indicating that dissipation from stellar heating could cause this size.  The CoRoT space mission, launched on December 27th 2006, has been developed and is operated by CNES, with the contribution of Austria, Belgium, Brazil, ESA (RSSD and Science Programme), Germany and Spain. Partly based on observations obtained at the European Southern Observatory at Paranal and La Silla, Chile in programs 083.C-0690(A), 184.C-0639.},

	Abstract = {Context. The space telescope CoRoT searches for transiting extrasolar planets by continuously monitoring the optical flux of thousands of stars in several fields of view.  Aims: We report the discovery of CoRoT-10b, a giant planet on a highly eccentric orbit (e = 0.53  &plusmn; 0.04) revolving in 13.24 days around a faint (V = 15.22) metal-rich K1V star.  Methods: We used CoRoT photometry, radial velocity observations taken with the HARPS spectrograph, and UVES spectra of the parent star to derive the orbital, stellar, and planetary parameters.  Results: We derive a radius of the planet of 0.97  &plusmn; 0.07  R<sub>{Jup}</sub> and a mass of 2.75  &plusmn; 0.16  M<sub>{Jup}</sub>. The bulk density, rhop = 3.70  &plusmn; 0.83  g cm<sup>{-3}</sup>, is ~2.8 that of Jupiter. The core of CoRoT-10b could contain up to 240 M_⊕ of heavy elements. Moving along its eccentric orbit, the planet experiences a 10.6-fold variation in insolation. Owing to the long circularisation time, taucirc > 7 Gyr, a resonant perturber is not required to excite and maintain the high eccentricity of CoRoT-10b.  The CoRoT space mission, launched on December 27th 2006, has been developed and is operated by CNES, with the contribution of Austria, Belgium, Brazil, ESA (RSSD and Science Programme), Germany and Spain.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We report the discovery of CoRoT-8b, a dense small Saturn-class exoplanet that orbits a K1 dwarf in 6.2 days, and we derive its orbital parameters, mass, and radius.  Methods: We analyzed two complementary data sets: the photometric transit curve of CoRoT-8b as measured by CoRoT and the radial velocity curve of CoRoT-8 as measured by the HARPS spectrometer.  Results: We find that CoRoT-8b is on a circular orbit with a semi-major axis of 0.063  &plusmn; 0.001 AU. It has a radius of 0.57  &plusmn; 0.02  R<sub>{Jup}</sub>, a mass of 0.22  &plusmn; 0.03  M<sub>{Jup}</sub>, and therefore a mean density of 1.6  &plusmn; 0.1  g cm<sup>{-3}</sup>.  Conclusions: With 67% of the size of Saturn and 72% of its mass, CoRoT-8b has a density comparable to that of Neptune (1.76  g cm<sup>{-3}</sup>). We estimate its content in heavy elements to be 47-63  M<sub>{&oplus;}</sub>, and the mass of its hydrogen-helium envelope to be 7-23 {M}_⊕. At 0.063 AU, the thermal loss of hydrogen of CoRoT-8b should be no more than  0.1% over an assumed integrated lifetime of 3 Ga.

	Abstract = {We report the discovery by the CoRoT space mission of a transiting brown dwarf orbiting a F7V star with an orbital period of 3.06 days. CoRoT-15b has a radius of 1.12<sub>-0.15</sub><sup>+0.30</sup>  R<sub>{Jup}</sub> and a mass of 63.3  &plusmn; 4.1  M<sub>{Jup}</sub>, and is thus the second transiting companion lying in the theoretical mass domain of brown dwarfs. CoRoT-15b is either very young or inflated compared to standard evolution models, a situation similar to that of M-dwarf stars orbiting close to solar-type stars. Spectroscopic constraints and an analysis of the lightcurve imply a spin period in the range 2.9-3.1 days for the central star, which is compatible with a double-synchronisation of the system.

	Abstract = {We report the strategy and results of our radial velocity follow-up campaign with the SOPHIE spectrograph (1.93-m OHP) of four transiting planetary candidates discovered by the Kepler space mission. We discuss the selection of the candidates KOI-428, KOI-410, KOI-552, and KOI-423. KOI-428 was established as a hot Jupiter transiting the largest and the most evolved star discovered so far and is described by Santerne et al. (2011, A&A, 528, A63). KOI-410 does not present radial velocity change greater than 120 m s-1, which allows us to exclude at 3sigma a transiting companion heavier than 3.4  M<sub>{Jup}</sub>. KOI-552b appears to be a transiting low-mass star with a mass ratio of 0.15. KOI-423b is a new transiting companion in the overlapping region between massive planets and brown dwarfs. With a radius of 1.22  &plusmn; 0.11  R<sub>{Jup}</sub> and a mass of 18.0  &plusmn; 0.92  M<sub>{Jup}</sub>, KOI-423b is orbiting an F7IV star with a period of 21.0874  &plusmn; 0.0002 days and an eccentricity of 0.12  &plusmn; 0.02. From the four selected Kepler candidates, at least three of them have a Jupiter-size transiting companion, but two of them are not in the mass domain of Jupiter-like planets. KOI-423b and KOI-522b are members of a growing population of known massive companions orbiting close to an F-type star. This population currently appears to be absent around G-type stars, possibly due to their rapid braking and the engulfment of their companions by tidal decay.  Based on observations made with the 1.93-m telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence (CNRS), France.},

	Abstract = {We provide updates to the Kepler planet candidate sample based upon nearly two years of high-precision photometry (i.e., Q1-Q8). From an initial list of nearly 13,400 threshold crossing events, 480 new host stars are identified from their flux time series as consistent with hosting transiting planets. Potential transit signals are subjected to further analysis using the pixel-level data, which allows background eclipsing binaries to be identified through small image position shifts during transit. We also re-evaluate Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) 1-1609, which were identified early in the mission, using substantially more data to test for background false positives and to find additional multiple systems. Combining the new and previous KOI samples, we provide updated parameters for 2738 Kepler planet candidates distributed across 2017 host stars. From the combined Kepler planet candidates, 472 are new from the Q1-Q8 data examined in this study. The new Kepler planet candidates represent ~40% of the sample with R P ~ 1 R ⊕ and represent ~40% of the low equilibrium temperature (T eq < 300 K) sample. We review the known biases in the current sample of Kepler planet candidates relevant to evaluating planet population statistics with the current Kepler planet candidate sample.},

	Abstract = {We announce the discovery of the transiting planet CoRoT-13b. Ground-based follow-up in CFHT and IAC80 confirmed CoRoT's observations. The mass of the planet was measured with the HARPS spectrograph and the properties of the host star were obtained analyzing HIRES spectra from the Keck telescope. It is a hot Jupiter-like planet with an orbital period of 4.04 days, 1.3 Jupiter masses, 0.9 Jupiter radii, and a density of 2.34  g cm<sup>{-3}</sup>. It orbits a G0V star with T_eff = 5 945 K,  M<sub>{&star;}</sub> = 1.09 M <sub>&odot;</sub>,  R<sub>{&star;}</sub> = 1.01 R <sub>&odot;</sub>, solar metallicity, a lithium content of + 1.45 dex, and an estimated age of between 0.12 and 3.15 Gyr. The lithium abundance of the star is consistent with its effective temperature, activity level, and age range derived from the stellar analysis. The density of the planet is extreme for its mass, implies that heavy elements are present with a mass of between about 140 and 300 {M}⊕.  The CoRoT space mission, launched on December 27th 2006, has been developed and is operated by CNES, with the contribution of Austria, Belgium, Brazil, ESA (RSSD and Science Programme), Germany and Spain.

	Abstract = {Context. CoRoT is a pioneering space mission whose primary goals are stellar seismology and extrasolar planets search. Its surveys of large stellar fields generate numerous planetary candidates whose lightcurves have transit-like features. An extensive analytical and observational follow-up effort is undertaken to classify these candidates.  Aims: We present the list of planetary transit candidates from the CoRoT LRa01 star field in the Monoceros constellation toward the Galactic anti-center direction. The CoRoT observations of LRa01 lasted from 24 October 2007 to 3 March 2008.  Methods: We acquired and analyzed 7470 chromatic and 3938 monochromatic lightcurves. Instrumental noise and stellar variability were treated with several filtering tools by different teams from the CoRoT community. Different transit search algorithms were applied to the lightcurves.  Results: Fifty-one stars were classified as planetary transit candidates in LRa01. Thirty-seven (i.e., 73% of all candidates) are "good" planetary candidates based on photometric analysis only. Thirty-two (i.e., 87% of the "good" candidates) have been followed-up. At the time of writing twenty-two cases were solved and five planets were discovered: three transiting hot-Jupiters (CoRoT-5b, CoRoT-12b, and CoRoT-21b), the first terrestrial transiting planet (CoRoT-7b), and another planet in the same system (CoRoT-7c, detected by radial velocity survey only). Evidence of another non-transiting planet in the CoRoT-7 system, namely CoRoT-7d, was recently found as well.  The CoRoT space mission, launched on December 27, 2006, has been developed and is operated by CNES, with contributions of Austria, Belgium, Brazil, ESA (RSSD and Science Program), Germany and Spain.},

	Abstract = {Of the over 400 known exoplanets, there are about 70 planets that transit their central star, a situation that permits the derivation of their basic parameters and facilitates investigations of their atmospheres. Some short-period planets, including the first terrestrial exoplanet (CoRoT-7b), have been discovered using a space mission designed to find smaller and more distant planets than can be seen from the ground. Here we report transit observations of CoRoT-9b, which orbits with a period of 95.274days on a low eccentricity of 0.11 &plusmn;0.04 around a solar-like star. Its periastron distance of 0.36 astronomical units is by far the largest of all transiting planets, yielding a `temperate' photospheric temperature estimated to be between 250 and 430K. Unlike previously known transiting planets, the present size of CoRoT-9b should not have been affected by tidal heat dissipation processes. Indeed, the planet is found to be well described by standard evolution models with an inferred interior composition consistent with that of Jupiter and Saturn.},

The planet has a mass of 4.24  &plusmn; 0.23  M<sub>{Jup}</sub> and a radius of 0.84  &plusmn; 0.04  R<sub>{Jup}</sub>. With a mean density of 8.87  &plusmn; 1.10  g cm<sup>{-3}</sup>, it is among the most compact planets known so far. Evolutionary models for the planet suggest a mass of heavy elements of the order of 800  M<sub>{&oplus;}</sub> if embedded in a central core, requiring a revision either of the planet formation models or both planet evolution and structure models. We note however that smaller amounts of heavy elements are expected by more realistic models in which they are mixed throughout the envelope. The planet orbits a G-type star with an orbital period of 9.24 days and an eccentricity of 0.56.The star's projected rotational velocity is vsini = 4.5  &plusmn; 1.0  km s<sup>{-1}</sup>, corresponding to a spin period of 11.5  &plusmn; 3.1 days if its axis of rotation is perpendicular to the orbital plane.

	Abstract = {Context. Hot Jupiters are still a fascinating exoplanet population that presents a diversity we are still far from understanding. High-precision photometric observations combined with radial velocity measurements give us a unique opportunity to constrain their properties better, on both their internal structure and their atmospheric bulk properties.  Aims: We initiated a follow-up program of Kepler-released planet candidates with the goal of confirming the planetary nature of a number of them through radial velocity measurements. For those that successfully passed the radial velocity screening, we furthermore performed a detailed exploration of their properties to characterize the systems. As a byproduct, these systematic observations allow us to consolidate the exoplanets' occurrence rate.  Methods: We performed a complete analysis of the Kepler-412 system, listed as planet candidate KOI-202 in the Kepler catalog, by combining the Kepler observations from Q1 to Q15, to ground-based spectroscopic observations that allowed us to derive radial velocity measurements, together with the host-star parameters and properties. We also analyzed the light curve to derive the star's rotation period and the phase function of the planet, including the secondary eclipse.  Results: We secured the planetary nature of Kepler-412b. We found the planet has a mass of 0.939  &plusmn; 0.085 M<sub>{Jup}</sub> and a radius of 1.325  &plusmn; 0.043 R<sub>{Jup}</sub>, which makes it a member of the bloated giant subgroup. It orbits its G3 V host star in 1.72 days. The system has an isochronal age of 5.1 Gyr, consistent with its moderate stellar activity as observed in the Kepler light curve and the rotation of the star of 17.2  &plusmn; 1.6 days. From the detected secondary we derived the day-side temperature as a function of the geometric albedo. We estimated that the geometrical albedo Ag should be between 0.094  &plusmn; 0.015 and 0.013<sub>-0.013</sub><sup>+0.017</sup> and the brightness of the day side 2380  &plusmn; 40 K. The measured night-side flux corresponds to a night-side brightness temperature of 2154  &plusmn; 83 K, much greater than what is expected for a planet with homogeneous heat redistribution. From the comparison to star and planet evolution models, we found that dissipation should operate in the deep interior of the planet. This modeling also shows that despite its inflated radius, the planet presents a noticeable amount of heavy elements, which accounts for a mass fraction of 0.11  &plusmn; 0.04.},

The detection of part of the radial velocity anomaly caused by the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect shows that the transit-like events detected by CoRoT are caused by a planet-sized transiting object in a prograde orbit. The relatively high projected rotational velocity of the star (v sin i = 40 &plusmn;5  km s<sup>{-1}</sup>) places CoRoT-11 among the most rapidly rotating planet host stars discovered so far. With a planetary mass of Mp = 2.33 &plusmn;0.34  M<sub>{Jup}</sub> and radius Rp =1.43 &plusmn;0.03  R<sub>{Jup}</sub>, the resulting mean density of CoRoT-11b (rhop = 0.99 &plusmn;0.15  g cm<sup>{-3}</sup>) can be explained with a model for an inflated hydrogen-planet with a solar composition and a high level of energy dissipation in its interior.

	Abstract = {Context. Observations of transiting extrasolar planets are of key importance to our understanding of planets because their mass, radius, and mass density can be determined. These measurements indicate that planets of similar mass can have very different radii. For low-density planets, it is generally assumed that they are inflated owing to their proximity to the host-star. To determine the causes of this inflation, it is necessary to obtain a statistically significant sample of planets with precisely measured masses and radii.  Aims: The CoRoT space mission allows us to achieve a very high photometric accuracy. By combining CoRoT data with high-precision radial velocity measurements, we derive precise planetary radii and masses. We report the discovery of CoRoT-19b, a gas-giant planet transiting an old, inactive F9V-type star with a period of four days.  Methods: After excluding alternative physical configurations mimicking a planetary transit signal, we determine the radius and mass of the planet by combining CoRoT photometry with high-resolution spectroscopy obtained with the echelle spectrographs SOPHIE, HARPS, FIES, and SANDIFORD. To improve the precision of its ephemeris and the epoch, we observed additional transits with the TRAPPIST and Euler telescopes. Using HARPS spectra obtained during the transit, we then determine the projected angle between the spin of the star and the orbit of the planet.  Results: We find that the host star of CoRoT-19b is an inactive F9V-type star close to the end of its main-sequence life. The host star has a mass  M<sub>{&star;}</sub> = 1.21  &plusmn; 0.05 M <sub>&odot;</sub> and radius  R<sub>{&star;}</sub> = 1.65  &plusmn; 0.04 R&sun;. The planet has a mass of MP = 1.11  &plusmn; 0.06  M<sub>{Jup}</sub> and radius of RP = 1.29  &plusmn; 0.03  R<sub>{Jup}</sub>. The resulting bulk density is only rho = 0.71  &plusmn; 0.06  g cm<sup>{-3}</sup>, which is much lower than that for Jupiter.  Conclusions: The exoplanet CoRoT-19b is an example of a giant planet of almost the same mass as Jupiter but a ≈30% larger radius.  The CoRoT space mission, launched on December 27, 2006, has been developed and is operated by the CNES, with the contribution of Austria, Belgium, Brazil, ESA (RSSD and Science Program), Germany and Spain.

	Abstract = {Context. CoRoT-2b is one of the most anomalously large exoplanet known. Given its high mass, its large radius cannot be explained by standard evolution models. Interestingly, the planet's parent star is an active, rapidly rotating solar-like star with with spots covering a large fraction (7-20%) of its visible surface.  Aims: We attempt to constrain the properties of the star-planet system and understand whether the planet's inferred large size may be caused a systematic error in the inferred parameters, and if not, how it can be explained.  Methods: We combine stellar and planetary evolution codes based on all available spectroscopic and photometric data to obtain self-consistent constraints on the system parameters.  Results: We find no systematic error in the stellar modeling (including spots and stellar activity) that would cause a ~10% reduction in size of the star and thus the planet. Two classes of solutions are found: the usual main-sequence solution for the star yields for the planet a mass of 3.67  &plusmn; 0.13  M<sub>{Jup}</sub>, a radius of 1.55  &plusmn; 0.03  R<sub>{Jup}</sub> for an age that is at least 130 Ma and should be younger than 500 Ma given the star's rapid rotation and significant activity. We identify another class of solutions on the pre-main sequence, for which the planet's mass is 3.45  &plusmn; 0.27  M<sub>{Jup}</sub> and its radius is 1.50  &plusmn; 0.06  R<sub>{Jup}</sub> for an age of 30 to 40 Ma. These extremely young solutions provide the simplest explanation of the planet's size that can then be matched by a simple contraction from an initially hot, expanded state, if the atmospheric opacities are larger by a factor of ~3 than usually assumed for solar composition atmospheres. Other solutions imply that the present inflated radius of CoRoT-2b is transient and the result of an event that occurred less than 20 Ma ago, i.e., a giant impact with another Jupiter-mass planet, or interactions with another object in the system that caused a significant rise in the eccentricity followed by the rapid circularization of its orbit.  Conclusions: Additional observations of CoRoT-2 that could help us to understand this system include searches for an infrared excess, a debris disk, and additional companions. The determination of a complete infrared lightcurve including both the primary and secondary transits would also be extremely valuable to constrain the planet's atmospheric properties and determine the planet-to-star radius ratio in a manner less vulnerable to systematic errors caused by stellar activity.},

	Abstract = {Studying exoplanets with their parent stars is crucial to understand their population, formation and history. We review some of the key questions regarding their evolution with particular emphasis on giant gaseous exoplanets orbiting close to solar-type stars. For masses above that of Saturn, transiting exoplanets have large radii indicative of the presence of a massive hydrogen-helium envelope. Theoretical models show that this envelope progressively cools and contracts with a rate of energy loss inversely proportional to the planetary age. The combined measurement of planetary mass, radius and a constraint on the (stellar) age enables a global determination of the amount of heavy elements present in the planet interior. The comparison with stellar metallicity shows a correlation between the two, indicating that accretion played a crucial role in the formation of planets. The dynamical evolution of exoplanets also depends on the properties of the central star. We show that the lack of massive giant planets and brown dwarfs in close orbit around G-dwarfs and their presence around F-dwarfs are probably tied to the different properties of dissipation in the stellar interiors. Both the evolution and the composition of stars and planets are intimately linked.},

	Abstract = {The discovery of multiple transiting planetary systems offers new possibilities for characterising exoplanets and understanding their formation. The Kepler-9 system contains two Saturn-mass planets, Kepler-9b and 9c. Using evolution models of gas giants that reproduce the sizes of known transiting planets and accounting for all sources of uncertainties, we show that Kepler-9b (respectively 9c) contains 45<sub>-12</sub><sup>+17</sup>  M<sub>{&oplus;}</sub> (resp. 31<sub>-10</sub><sup>+13</sup> M⊕) of hydrogen and helium and 35<sub>-15</sub><sup>+10</sup>  M<sub>{&oplus;}</sub> (resp. 24<sub>-12</sub><sup>+10</sup> M⊕) of heavy elements. More accurate constraints are obtained when comparing planets 9b and 9c: the ratio of the total mass fractions of heavy elements are Zb/Zc = 1.02  &plusmn; 0.14, indicating that, although the masses of the planets differ, their global composition is very similar, an unexpected result for formation models. Using evolution models for super-Earths, we find that Kepler-9d must contain less than 0.1% of its mass in hydrogen and helium and predict a mostly rocky structure with a total mass between 4 and 16 M⊕.

	Abstract = {We report the detection of CoRoT-18b, a massive hot Jupiter transiting in front of its host star with a period of 1.9000693  &plusmn; 0.0000028 days. This planet was discovered thanks to photometric data secured with the CoRoT satellite combined with spectroscopic and photometric ground-based follow-up observations. The planet has a mass Mp = 3.47  &plusmn; 0.38  M<sub>{Jup}</sub>, a radius Rp = 1.31  &plusmn; 0.18  R<sub>{Jup}</sub>, and a density rhop = 2.2  &plusmn; 0.8  g cm<sup>{-3}</sup>.

The age of the system remains uncertain, with stellar evolution models pointing either to a few tens Ma or several Ga, while gyrochronology and lithium abundance point towards ages of a few hundred Ma. This mismatch potentially points to a problem in our understanding of the evolution of young stars, with possibly significant implications for stellar physics and the interpretation of inferred sizes of exoplanets around young stars. We detected the Rossiter-McLaughlin anomaly in the CoRoT-18 system thanks to the spectroscopic observation of a transit. We measured the obliquity psi = 20$\,^{\circ}$  &plusmn; 20$\,^{\circ}$ (sky-projected value lambda = -10$\,^{\circ}$  &plusmn; 20$\,^{\circ}$), indicating that the planet orbits in the same way as the star is rotating and that this prograde orbit is nearly aligned with the stellar equator.

	Abstract = {The CoRoT space observatory is a project which is led by the French space agency CNES and leading space research institutes in Austria, Brazil, Belgium, Germany and Spain and also the European Space Agency ESA. CoRoT observed since its launch in December 27, 2006 about 100 000 stars for the exoplanet channel, during 150 days uninterrupted high-precision photometry. Since the The CoRoT-team has several exoplanet candidates which are currently analyzed under its study, we report here the discoveries of nine exoplanets which were observed by CoRoT. Discovered exoplanets such as CoRoT-3b populate the brown dwarf desert and close the gap of measured physical properties between usual gas giants and very low mass stars. CoRoT discoveries extended the known range of planet masses down to about 4.8 Earth-masses (CoRoT-7b) and up to 21 Jupiter masses (CoRoT-3b), the radii to about 1.68 × 0.09  R<sub>{Earth}</sub> (CoRoT-7b) and up to the most inflated hot Jupiter with 1.49 × 0.09  R<sub>{Earth}</sub> found so far (CoRoT-1b), and the transiting exoplanet with the longest period of 95.274 days (CoRoT-9b). Giant exoplanets have been detected at low metallicity, rapidly rotating and active, spotted stars. Two CoRoT planets have host stars with the lowest content of heavy elements known to show a transit hinting towards a different planethost-star-metallicity relation then the one found by radial-velocity search programs. Finally the properties of the CoRoT-7b prove that rocky planets with a density close to Earth exist outside the Solar System. Finally the detection of the secondary transit of CoRoT-1b at a sensitivity level of 10-5 and the very clear detection of the "super-Earth" CoRoT-7b at 3.5 × 10-4 relative flux are promising evidence that the space observatory is being able to detect even smaller exoplanets with the size of the Earth.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We report the discovery of a massive and dense transiting planet CoRoT-27b on a 3.58-day orbit around a 4.2 Gyr-old G2 star. The planet candidate was identified from the CoRoT photometry, and was confirmed as a planet with ground-based spectroscopy.  Methods: The confirmation of the planet candidate is based on radial velocity observations combined with imaging to rule out blends. The characterisation of the planet and its host star was carried out using a Bayesian approach where all the data (CoRoT photometry, radial velocities, and spectroscopic characterisation of the star) are used jointly. The Bayesian analysis included a study whether the assumption of white normally distributed noise holds for the CoRoT photometry and whether the use of a non-normal noise distribution offers advantages in parameter estimation and model selection.  Results: CoRoT-27b has a mass of 10.39  &plusmn; 0.55 M<sub>{Jup}</sub>, a radius of 1.01  &plusmn; 0.04 R<sub>{Jup}</sub>, a mean density of 12.6<sub>-1.67</sub><sup>+1.92</sup> g cm<sup>{-3}</sup>, and an effective temperature of 1500  &plusmn; 130 K. The planet orbits around its host star, a 4.2 Gyr-old G2-star with a mass  M<sub>{&star;}</sub> = 1.06M <sub>&odot;</sub> and a radius  R<sub>{&star;}</sub> = 1.05R <sub>&odot;</sub>, on a 0.048  &plusmn; 0.007 AU orbit of 3.58 days. The radial velocity observations allow us to exclude highly eccentric orbits, namely, e < 0.065 with 99% confidence. Given its high mass and density, theoretical modelling of CoRoT-27b is demanding. We identify two solutions with heavy element mass fractions of 0.11  &plusmn; 0.08 M<sub>{&oplus;}</sub> and 0.07  &plusmn; 0.06 M<sub>{&oplus;}</sub>, but even solutions void of heavy elements cannot be excluded. We carry out a secondary eclipse search from the CoRoT photometry using a method based on Bayesian model selection, but conclude that the noise level is too high to detect eclipses shallower than 9% of the transit depth. Using a non-normal noise model was shown not to affect the parameter estimation results, but led to significant improvement in the sensitivity of the model selection process.

	Abstract = {We report the detection of CoRoT-23b, a hot Jupiter transiting in front of its host star with a period of 3.6314  &plusmn; 0.0001 days. This planet was discovered thanks to photometric data secured with the CoRoT satellite, combined with spectroscopic radial velocity (RV) measurements. A photometric search for possible background eclipsing binaries conducted at CFHT and OGS concluded with a very low risk of false positives. The usual techniques of combining RV and transit data simultaneously were used to derive stellar and planetary parameters. The planet has a mass of Mp = 2.8  &plusmn; 0.3  M<sub>{Jup}</sub>, a radius of Rpl= 1.05  &plusmn; 0.13 R<sub>{Jup}</sub>, a density of ≈ 3  g cm<sup>{-3}</sup>. RV data also clearly reveal a nonzero eccentricity of e = 0.16  &plusmn; 0.02. The planet orbits a mature G0 main sequence star of V = 15.5 mag, with a mass  M<sub>{&star;}</sub> = 1.14  &plusmn; 0.08 M <sub>&odot;</sub>, a radius  R<sub>{&star;}</sub> = 1. 61  &plusmn; 0.18 R <sub>&odot;</sub> and quasi-solarabundances. The age of the system is evaluated to be 7 Gyr, not far from the transition to subgiant, in agreement with the rather large stellar radius. The two features of a significant eccentricity of the orbit and of a fairly high density are fairly uncommon for a hot Jupiter. The high density is, however, consistent with a model of contraction of a planet at this mass, given the age of the system. On the other hand, at such an age, circularization is expected to be completed. In fact, we show that for this planetary mass and orbital distance, any initial eccentricity should not totally vanish after 7 Gyr, as long as the tidal quality factor Qp is more than a few 105, a value that is the lower bound of the usually expected range. Even if CoRoT-23b features a density and an eccentricity that are atypical of a hot Jupiter, it is thus not an enigmatic object.  The CoRoT space mission, launched on 27 December 2006, has been developed and is operated by CNES, with the contribution of Austria, Belgium, Brazil, ESA, Germany, and Spain. First CoRoT data are available to the public from the CoRoT archive: http://idoc-corot.ias.u-psud.fr. The complementary observations were obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by NRC in Canada, INSU-CNRS in France, and the University of Hawaii; ESO Telescopes at the La Silla and Paranal Observatories under program 184.C0639; the OGS telescope operated by the Instituto de Astrof{\'\i}sica de Tenerife at Tenerife.},
