	Abstract = {We apply the Bayesian framework to assess the presence of a correlation between two quantities. To do so, we estimate the probability distribution of the parameter of interest, $\rho$, characterizing the strength of the correlation. We provide an implementation of these ideas and concepts using python programming language and the pyMC module in a very short ($\sim$130 lines of code, heavily commented) and user-friendly program. We used this tool to assess the presence and properties of the correlation between planetary surface gravity and stellar activity level as measured by the log($R'_{\mathrm{HK}}$) indicator. The results of the Bayesian analysis are qualitatively similar to those obtained via p-value analysis, and support the presence of a correlation in the data. The results are more robust in their derivation and more informative, revealing interesting features such as asymmetric posterior distributions or markedly different credible intervals, and allowing for a deeper exploration. We encourage the reader interested in this kind of problem to apply our code to his/her own scientific problems. The full understanding of what the Bayesian framework is can only be gained through the insight that comes by handling priors, assessing the convergence of Monte Carlo runs, and a multitude of other practical problems. We hope to contribute so that Bayesian analysis becomes a tool in the toolkit of researchers, and they understand by experience its advantages and limitations.},

	Abstract = {We describe an online database for extrasolar planetary-mass candidates, which is updated regularly as new data are available. We first discuss criteria for inclusion of objects in the catalog: "definition" of a planet and several aspects of the confidence level of planet candidates. We are led to point out the contradiction between the sharpness of criteria for belonging to a catalog and the fuzziness of the confidence level for an object to be a planet. We then describe the different tables of extrasolar planetary systems, including unconfirmed candidates (which will ultimately be confirmed, or not, by direct imaging). It also provides online tools: histograms of planet and host star data, cross-correlations between these parameters, and some Virtual Observatory services. Future evolutions of the database are presented.},

	Abstract = {The Exoplanet Orbit Database (EOD) compiles orbital, transit, host star, and other parameters of robustly-detected exoplanets reported in the peer-reviewed literature. The EOD can be navigated through the Exoplanet Data Explorer (EDE) plotter and table, available on the World Wide Web at http://exoplanets.org. The EOD contains data for 1492 confirmed exoplanets as of 2014 July. The EOD descends from a table provided by Butler and coworkers in 2002 and the Catalog of Nearby Exoplanets (Butler and coworkers in 2006), and the first complete documentation for the EOD and the EDE was presented by Wright and coworkers in 2011. In this work, we describe our work since then. We have expanded the scope of the EOD to include secondary eclipse parameters and asymmetric uncertainties and expanded the EDE to include the sample of over 3000 Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) and other real planets without good orbital parameters (such as many of those detected by microlensing and imaging). Users can download the latest version of the entire EOD as a single comma separated value file from the front page of http://exoplanets.org.},

@article{Thorngren:2015,
	Abstract = {Exoplanet discoveries of recent years have provided a great deal of new data for studying the bulk compositions of giant planets. Here we identify 38 transiting giant planets ($20 M_\oplus < M < 20 M_{\mathrm{J}}$) whose stellar insolation is low enough ($F_* < 2\times10^8\; \text{erg}\; \text{s}^{-1}\; \text{cm}^{-2}$, or roughly $T_\text{eff} < 1000$) that they are not affected by the hot Jupiter radius inflation mechanism(s). We compute a set of new thermal and structural evolution models and use these models in comparison with properties of the 38 transiting planets (mass, radius, age) to determine their heavy element masses. A clear correlation emerges between the planetary heavy element mass $M_z$ and the total planet mass, approximately of the form $M_z \propto \sqrt{M}$. This finding is consistent with the core accretion model of planet formation. We also study how stellar metallicity [Fe/H] affects planetary metal-enrichment and find a weaker correlation than has been previously reported from studies with smaller sample sizes. Our results suggest that planets with large heavy element masses are more common around stars with a high iron abundance, but are not found there exclusively. We confirm a strong relationship between the planetary metal-enrichment relative to the parent star $Z_{\rm planet}/Z_{\rm star}$ and the planetary mass, but see no relation in $Z_{\rm planet}/Z_{\rm star}$ with planet orbital properties or stellar mass. Suggestively, circumbinary planets are more enriched in heavy elements than similar mass single-star planets, but with only four such planets the effect is not yet significant. The large heavy element masses of many planets ($>50 M_\oplus$) suggest significant amounts of heavy elements in H/He envelopes, rather than cores, such that metal-enriched giant planet atmospheres should be the rule.},

@article{Maldonado:2013a,
	Abstract = {Context. Currently, the core accretion model has its strongest observational evidence on the chemical signature of mostly main sequence stars with planets.  Aims: We aim to test whether the well-established correlation between the metallicity of the star and the presence of giant planets found for main sequence stars still holds for the evolved and generally more massive giant and subgiant stars. Although several attempts have been made so far, the results are not conclusive since they are based on small or inhomogeneous samples.  Methods: We determine in a homogeneous way the metallicity and individual abundances of a large sample of evolved stars, with and without known planetary companions, and discuss their metallicity distribution and trends. Our methodology is based on the analysis of high-resolution {\'e}chelle spectra (R >= 67 000) from 2-3 m class telescopes. It includes the calculation of the fundamental stellar parameters (Teff, log g, microturbulent velocity, and metallicity) by applying iron ionisation and excitation equilibrium conditions to several isolated Fe i and Fe ii lines, as well as, calculating individual abundances of different elements such as Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Co, or Ni.  Results: The metallicity distributions show that giant stars hosting planets are not preferentially metal-rich because they have similar abundance patterns to giant stars without known planetary companions. We have found, however, a very strong relation between the metallicity distribution and the stellar mass within this sample. We show that while the less massive giant stars with planets (M* <= 1.5 M&sun;) are not metal rich, the metallicity of the sample of massive (M* > 1.5 M&sun;), young (age < 2 Gyr) giant stars with planets is higher than that of a similar sample of stars without planets. Regarding other chemical elements, giant stars with and without planets in the mass domain M* <= 1.5 M&sun; show similar abundance patterns. However, planet and non-planet hosts with masses M* > 1.5 M&sun; show differences in the abundances of some elements, specially Na, Co, and Ni. In addition, we find the sample of subgiant stars with planets to be metal rich, showing similar metallicities to main-sequence planet hosts.  Conclusions: While the metallicity distribution of planet-hosting subgiant stars and giant stars with stellar masses M* > 1.5 M&sun; fits well in the predictions of current core-accretion models, the fact that giant planet hosts in the mass domain M* <= 1.5 M&sun; do not show metal enrichment is difficult to explain. Given that these stars have similar stellar parameters to subgiants and main-sequence planet hosts, the lack of the metal-rich signature in low-mass giants could be explained by a pollution scenario in the main sequence that gets erased as the star becomes fully convective. However, there is no physical reason why it should play a role for giants with masses M* <= 1.5 M&sun; yet not be observed for giants with M* > 1.5 M&sun;.

	Abstract = {We report on the orbital architectures of Kepler systems having multiple-planet candidates identified in the analysis of data from the first six quarters of Kepler data and reported by Batalha et al. (2013). These data show 899 transiting planet candidates in 365 multiple-planet systems and provide a powerful means to study the statistical properties of planetary systems. Using a generic mass-radius relationship, we find that only two pairs of planets in these candidate systems (out of 761 pairs total) appear to be on Hill-unstable orbits, indicating ~96% of the candidate planetary systems are correctly interpreted as true systems. We find that planet pairs show little statistical preference to be near mean-motion resonances. We identify an asymmetry in the distribution of period ratios near first-order resonances (e.g., 2:1, 3:2), with an excess of planet pairs lying wide of resonance and relatively few lying narrow of resonance. Finally, based upon the transit duration ratios of adjacent planets in each system, we find that the interior planet tends to have a smaller transit impact parameter than the exterior planet does. This finding suggests that the mode of the mutual inclinations of planetary orbital planes is in the range 1.$\,^{\circ}$0-2.$\,^{\circ}$2, for the packed systems of small planets probed by these observations.},

	Abstract = {Although tidally locked habitable planets orbiting nearby M-dwarf stars are among the best astronomical targets to search for extrasolar life, they may also be deficient in volatiles and water. Climate models for this class of planets show atmospheric transport of water from the dayside to the nightside, where it is precipitated as snow and trapped as ice. Since ice only slowly flows back to the dayside upon accumulation, the resulting hydrological cycle can trap a large amount of water in the form of nightside ice. Using ice sheet dynamical and thermodynamical constraints, I illustrate how planets with less than about a quarter the Earth's oceans could trap most of their surface water on the nightside. This would leave their dayside, where habitable conditions are met, potentially dry. The amount and distribution of residual liquid water on the dayside depend on a variety of geophysical factors, including the efficiency of rock weathering at regulating atmospheric CO2 as dayside ocean basins dry up. Water-trapped worlds with dry daysides may offer similar advantages as land planets for habitability, by contrast with worlds where more abundant water freely flows around the globe.},

	Abstract = {The Kepler-36 system consists of two planets that are spaced unusually close together, near the 7:6 mean motion resonance. While it is known that mean motion resonances can easily form by convergent migration, Kepler-36 is an extreme case due to the close spacing and the relatively high planet masses of four and eight times that of the Earth. In this paper, we investigate whether such a system can be obtained by interactions with the protoplanetary disc. These discs are thought to be turbulent and exhibit density fluctuations which might originate from the magnetorotational instability. We adopt a realistic description for stochastic forces due to these density fluctuations and perform both long-term hydrodynamical and N-body simulations. Our results show that planets in the Kepler-36 mass range can be naturally assembled into a closely spaced planetary system for a wide range of migration parameters in a turbulent disc similar to the minimum-mass solar nebula. The final orbits of our formation scenarios tend to be Lagrange stable, even though large parts of the parameter space are chaotic and unstable.},

@article{Lopez:2013,
	Abstract = {We use models of coupled thermal evolution and photo-evaporative mass loss to understand the formation and evolution of the Kepler-36 system. We show that the large contrast in mean planetary density observed by Carter et al. can be explained as a natural consequence of photo-evaporation from planets that formed with similar initial compositions. However, rather than being due to differences in XUV irradiation between the planets, we find that this contrast is due to the difference in the masses of the planets' rock/iron cores and the impact that this has on mass-loss evolution. We explore in detail how our coupled models depend on irradiation, mass, age, composition, and the efficiency of mass loss. Based on fits to large numbers of coupled evolution and mass-loss runs, we provide analytic fits to understand threshold XUV fluxes for significant atmospheric loss, as a function of core mass and mass-loss efficiency. Finally we discuss these results in the context of recent studies of the radius distribution of Kepler candidates. Using our parameter study, we make testable predictions for the frequency of sub-Neptune-sized planets. We show that 1.8-4.0 R ⊕ planets should become significantly less common on orbits within 10 days and discuss the possibility of a narrow "occurrence valley" in the radius-flux distribution. Moreover, we describe how photo-evaporation provides a natural explanation for the recent observations of Ciardi et al. that inner planets are preferentially smaller within the systems.},

	Abstract = {The ongoing characterization of hot Jupiters has motivated a variety of circulation models of their atmospheres. Such models must be integrated starting from an assumed initial state, which is typically taken to be a wind-free, rest state. Here, we investigate the sensitivity of hot-Jupiter atmospheric circulation to initial conditions with shallow-water models and full three-dimensional models. Those models are initialized with zonal jets, and we explore a variety of different initial jet profiles. We demonstrate that, in both classes of models, the final, equilibrated state is independent of initial condition---as long as frictional drag near the bottom of the domain and/or interaction with a specified planetary interior are included so that the atmosphere can adjust angular momentum over time relative to the interior. When such mechanisms are included, otherwise identical models initialized with vastly different initial conditions all converge to the same statistical steady state. In some cases, the models exhibit modest time variability; this variability results in random fluctuations about the statistical steady state, but we emphasize that, even in these cases, the statistical steady state itself does not depend on initial conditions. Although the outcome of hot-Jupiter circulation models depend on details of the radiative forcing and frictional drag, aspects of which remain uncertain, we conclude that the specification of initial conditions is not a source of uncertainty, at least over the parameter range explored in most current models.},

	Abstract = {In the core accretion model of giant planet formation, a solid protoplanetary core begins to accrete gas directly from the nebula when its mass reaches ~5 M⊕. The protoplanet has at most a few million years to reach runaway gas accretion, as young stars lose their gas disks after 10 million years at the latest. Yet gas accretion also brings small dust grains entrained in the gas into the planetary atmosphere. Dust accretion creates an optically thick protoplanetary atmosphere that cannot efficiently radiate away the kinetic energy deposited by incoming planetesimals. A dust-rich atmosphere severely slows down atmospheric cooling, contraction, and inflow of new gas, in contradiction to the observed timescales of planet formation. Here we show that photophoresis is a strong mechanism for pushing dust out of the planetary atmosphere due to the momentum exchange between gas and dust grains. The thermal radiation from the heated inner atmosphere and core is sufficient to levitate dust grains and to push them outward. Photophoresis can significantly accelerate the formation of giant planets.},

@article{Perez-Becker:2013a,
	Abstract = {Infrared light curves of transiting hot Jupiters present a trend in which the atmospheres of the hottest planets are less efficient at redistributing the stellar energy absorbed on their daysides---and thus have a larger day-night temperature contrast---than colder planets. To this day, no predictive atmospheric model has been published that identifies which dynamical mechanisms determine the atmospheric heat redistribution efficiency on tidally locked exoplanets. Here we present a shallow-water model of the atmospheric dynamics on synchronously rotating planets that explains why heat redistribution efficiency drops as stellar insolation rises. Our model shows that planets with weak friction and weak irradiation exhibit a banded zonal flow with minimal day-night temperature differences, while models with strong irradiation and/or strong friction exhibit a day-night flow pattern with order-unity fractional day-night temperature differences. To interpret the model, we develop a scaling theory which shows that the timescale for gravity waves to propagate horizontally over planetary scales, tauwave, plays a dominant role in controlling the transition from small to large temperature contrasts. This implies that heat redistribution is governed by a wave-like process, similar to the one responsible for the weak temperature gradients in the Earth's tropics. When atmospheric drag can be neglected, the transition from small to large day-night temperature contrasts occurs when \tau _{wave}\sim \sqrt{\tau _{rad}/\Omega }, where taurad is the radiative relaxation time and Omega is the planetary rotation frequency. Alternatively, this transition criterion can be expressed as taurad ~ tauvert, where tauvert is the timescale for a fluid parcel to move vertically over the difference in day-night thickness. These results subsume the more widely used timescale comparison for estimating heat redistribution efficiency between taurad and the horizontal day-night advection timescale, tauadv. Only because tauadv ~ tauvert for hot Jupiters does the commonly assumed timescale comparison between taurad and tauadv yield approximately correct predictions for the heat redistribution efficiency.},

@article{Mordasini:2013,
	Abstract = {Context. The intrinsic luminosity of young Jupiters is of high interest for planet formation theory. It is an observable quantity that is determined by important physical mechanisms during formation, namely, the structure of the accretion shock and, even more fundamentally, the basic formation mechanism (core accretion or gravitational instability).  Aims: Our aim is to study the impact of the core mass on the post-formation entropy and luminosity of young giant planets forming via core accretion with a supercritical accretion shock that radiates all accretion shock energy (cold accretion).  Methods: For this, we conduct self-consistently coupled formation and evolution calculations of giant planets with masses between 1 and 12 Jovian masses and core masses between 20 and 120 Earth masses in the 1D spherically symmetric approximation.  Results: As the main result, it is found that the post-formation luminosity of massive giant planets is very sensitive to the core mass. An increase in the core mass by a factor 6 results in an increase in the post-formation luminosity of a 10-Jovian mass planet by a factor 120, indicating a dependency as mcore2-3. Due to this dependency, there is no single well-defined post-formation luminosity for core accretion, but a wide range, even for completely cold accretion. For massive cores ( 100 Earth masses), the post-formation luminosities of core accretion planets become so high that they approach those in the hot start scenario that is often associated with gravitational instability. For the mechanism to work, it is necessary that the solids are accreted before or during gas runaway accretion and that they sink during this time deep into the planet.  Conclusions: We make no claims about whether such massive cores can actually form in giant planets especially at large orbital distances. But if they can form, it becomes difficult to rule out core accretion as the formation mechanism based solely on luminosity for directly imaged planets that are more luminous than predicted for low core masses. Instead of invoking gravitational instability as the consequently necessary formation mode, the high luminosity can also be caused, at least in principle, simply by a more massive core.},

	Abstract = {We substantially update the capabilities of the open source software package Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), and its one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESA star. Improvements in MESA star's ability to model the evolution of giant planets now extends its applicability down to masses as low as one-tenth that of Jupiter. The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS adiabatic pulsation code with MESA star. This also motivates a numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented when many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the way in which MESA star calculates semi-convective and thermohaline mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 M &sun; stars through the end of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival on the white dwarf cooling sequence. We implement diffusion of angular momentum and chemical abundances that enable calculations of rotating-star models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes that allows the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to core collapse. This enables the generation of new sets of supernovae, long gamma-ray burst, and pair-instability progenitor models. We substantially modify the way in which MESA star solves the fully coupled stellar structure and composition equations, and we show how this has improved the scaling of MESA's calculational speed on multi-core processors. Updates to the modules for equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and atmospheric boundary conditions are also provided. We describe the MESA Software Development Kit that packages all the required components needed to form a unified, maintained, and well-validated build environment for MESA. We also highlight a few tools developed by the community for rapid visualization of MESA star results.},

Starting from an observed mass-radius diagram for known planets in the universe, we will discuss the various types of planets appearing in this diagram and describe internal structures for each type. The review will summarize the status of theoretical and experimental works performed in the field of equations of state (EOS) for materials relevant to planetary interiors and will address the main theoretical and experimental uncertainties and challenges. It will discuss the impact of new EOS on interior structures and bulk composition determination. We will discuss important dynamical processes that strongly impact the interior and evolutionary properties of planets (e.g., plate tectonics, semiconvection) and describe nonstandard models recently suggested for our giant planets. We will address the case of short-period, strongly irradiated exoplanets and critically analyze some of the physical mechanisms that have been suggested to explain their anomalously large radius.},

@article{Lillo-Box:2014,
	Abstract = {Context. The evolution of planetary systems is intimately linked to the evolution of their host stars. Our understanding of the whole planetary evolution process is based on the wide planet diversity observed so far. Only a few tens of planets have been discovered orbiting stars ascending the red giant branch. Although several theories have been proposed, the question of how planets die remains open owing to the small number statistics, making it clear that the sample of planets around post-main sequence stars needs to be enlarged.  Aims: In this work we study the giant star Kepler-91 (KOI-2133) in order to determine the nature of a transiting companion. This system was detected by the Kepler Space Telescope, which identified small dims in its light curve with a period of 6.246580 $\pm$ 0.000082 days. However, its planetary confirmation is needed due to the large pixel size of the Kepler camera, which can hide other stellar configurations able to mimic planet-like transit events.  Methods: We analysed Kepler photometry to 1) re-calculate transit parameters; 2) study the light-curve modulations; and 3) to perform an asteroseismic analysis (accurate stellar parameter determination) by identifying solar-like oscillations on the periodogram. We also used a high-resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio spectrum obtained with the Calar Alto Fiber-fed {\'E}chelle spectrograph (CAFE) to measure stellar properties. Additionally, false-positive scenarios were rejected by obtaining high-resolution images with the AstraLux lucky imaging camera on the 2.2 m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory.  Results: We confirm the planetary nature of the object transiting the star Kepler-91 by deriving a mass of Mp=0.88+0.17-0.33 MJup and a planetary radius of Rp=1.384+0.011-0.054 RJup. Asteroseismic analysis produces a stellar radius of R* = 6.30 $\pm$ 0.16 R&sun; and a mass of M* = 1.31 $\pm$ 0.10 M&sun;. We find that its eccentric orbit (e=0.066+0.013-0.017) is just 1.32+0.07-0.22 R* away from the stellar atmosphere at the pericentre. We also detected three small dims in the phase-folded light curve. The combination of two of them agrees with the theoretical characteristics expected for secondary eclipse.  Conclusions: Kepler-91b could be the previous stage of the planet engulfment, which has recently been detected for BD+48 740. Our estimations show that Kepler-91b will be swallowed by its host star in less than 55 Myr. Among the confirmed planets around giant stars, this is the closest to its host star. At pericentre, the star subtends an angle of 48$\,^{\circ}$, covering around 10% of the sky as seen from the planet. The planetary atmosphere seems to be inflated probably due to the high stellar irradiation.

@article{Parmentier:2014,
	Abstract = {More than a thousand exoplanets have been discovered over the last decade. Perhaps more excitingly, probing their atmospheres has become possible. With current data we have glimpsed the diversity of exoplanet atmospheres that will be revealed over the coming decade. However, numerous questions concerning their chemical composition, thermal structure, and atmospheric dynamics remain to be answered. More observations of higher quality are needed. In the next years, the selection of a space-based mission dedicated to the spectroscopic characterization of exoplanets would revolutionize our understanding of the physics of planetary atmospheres. Such a mission was proposed to the ESA cosmic vision program in 2014. Our paper is therefore based on the planned capabilities of the Exoplanet Characterization Observatory (EChO), but it should equally apply to any future mission with similar characteristics. With its large spectral coverage (0.4 - 16 mum), high spectral resolution (lambda/Deltalambda > 300 below 5 mum and lambda/Deltalambda > 30 above 5 mum) and 1.5m mirror, a future mission such as EChO will provide spectrally resolved transit lightcurves, secondary eclipses lightcurves, and full phase curves of numerous exoplanets with an unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we review some of today's main scientific questions about gas giant exoplanets atmospheres, for which a future mission such as EChO will bring a decisive contribution.},

@inproceedings{Vidotto:2014,
	Abstract = {The great majority of exoplanets discovered so far are orbiting cool, low-mass stars whose properties are relatively similar to the Sun. However, the stellar magnetism of these stars can be significantly different from the solar one, both in topology and intensity. In addition, due to the present-day technology used in exoplanetary searches, most of the currently known exoplanets are found orbiting at extremely close distances to their host stars (< 0.1 au). The dramatic differences in stellar magnetism and orbital radius can make the interplanetary medium of exoplanetary systems remarkably distinct from that of the Solar System. To constrain interactions between exoplanets and their host-star's magnetised winds and to characterise the interplanetary medium that surrounds exoplanets, more realistic stellar wind models, which account for factors such as stellar rotation and the complex stellar magnetic field configurations of cool stars, must be employed. Here, I briefly review the latest progress made in data-driven modelling of magnetised stellar winds. I also show that the interaction of the stellar winds with exoplanets can lead to several observable signatures, some of which that are absent in our own Solar System.},

These features can also be used to study star-planet interactions as well as inferring properties from the underlying stellar dynamo. However, typical techniques, such as ZDI, are not possible for most host-stars. We present a robust method based on spot modelling to map the surface of active star allowing us to statistically study the effects and interactions of stellar magnetism with transiting exoplanets. The method is applied to the active Kepler-9 star where we find small evidence for a possible interaction between planet and stellar magnetosphere which leads to a 2:1 resonance between spot rotation and orbital period.},

	Abstract = {Over the last twenty years, the search for extrasolar planets has revealed the rich diversity of outcomes from the formation and evolution of planetary systems. In order to fully understand how these extrasolar planets came to be, however, the orbital and physical data we possess are not enough, and they need to be complemented with information about the composition of the exoplanets. Ground-based and space-based observations provided the first data on the atmospheric composition of a few extrasolar planets, but a larger and more detailed sample is required before we can fully take advantage of it. The primary goal of a dedicated space mission like the Exoplanet Characterization Observatory (EChO) proposal is to fill this gap and to expand the limited data we possess by performing a systematic survey of extrasolar planets. The full exploitation of the data that space-based and ground-based facilities will provide in the near future, however, requires knowledge about the sources and sinks of the chemical species and molecules that will be observed. Luckily, the study of the past history of the Solar System provides several indications about the effects of processes like migration, late accretion and secular impacts, and on the time they occur in the life of planetary systems. In this work we will review what is already known about the factors influencing the composition of planetary atmospheres, focusing on the case of gaseous giant planets, and what instead still need to be investigated.},

	Abstract = {Seismology allows for direct observational constraints on the interior structures of stars and planets. Recent observations of Saturn's ring system have revealed the presence of density waves within the rings excited by oscillation modes within Saturn, allowing for precise measurements of a limited set of the planet's mode frequencies. We construct interior structure models of Saturn, compute the corresponding mode frequencies, and compare them with the observed mode frequencies. The fundamental mode frequencies of our models match the observed frequencies (of the largest amplitude waves) to an accuracy of ~1%, confirming that these waves are indeed excited by Saturn's f-modes. The presence of the lower amplitude waves (finely split in frequency from the f-modes) can only be reproduced in models containing gravity modes that propagate in a stably stratified region of the planet. The stable stratification must exist deep within the planet near the large density gradients between the core and envelope. Our models cannot easily reproduce the observed fine splitting of the m =-3 modes, suggesting that additional effects (e.g., significant latitudinal differential rotation) may be important.},

	Abstract = {We report near-infrared spectroscopy of the gas giant planet HD 189733b in transit. We used the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (HST WFC3) with its G141 grism covering 1.1 mum to 1.7 mum and spatially scanned the image across the detector at 2'' s-1. When smoothed to 75 nm bins, the local maxima of the transit depths in the 1.15 mum and 1.4 mum water vapor features are, respectively, 83 $\pm$ 53 ppm and 200 $\pm$ 47 ppm greater than the local minimum at 1.3 mum. We compare the WFC3 spectrum with the composite transit spectrum of HD 189733b assembled by Pont et al., extending from 0.3 mum to 24 mum. Although the water vapor features in the WFC3 spectrum are compatible with the model of non-absorbing, Rayleigh-scattering dust in the planetary atmosphere, we also re-interpret the available data with a clear planetary atmosphere. In the latter interpretation, the slope of increasing transit depth with shorter wavelengths from the near infrared, through the visible, and into the ultraviolet is caused by unocculted star spots, with a smaller contribution of Rayleigh scattering by molecular hydrogen in the planet's atmosphere. At relevant pressures along the terminator, our model planetary atmosphere's temperature is ~700 K, which is below the condensation temperatures of sodium- and potassium-bearing molecules, causing the broad wings of the spectral lines of Na I and K I at 0.589 mum and 0.769 mum to be weak.},

	Abstract = {The Hubble Space Telescope and the Kepler space mission observed a large number of planetary transits showing anomalies due to starspot eclipses, with more such observations expected in the near future by the K2 mission and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. To facilitate analysis of this phenomenon, we present SPOTROD, a model for planetary transits of stars with an arbitrary limb darkening law and a number of homogeneous, circular spots on their surface. A free, open source implementation written in C, ready to use in PYTHON, is available for download. We analyse Kepler observations of the planetary host star HAT-P-11, and study the size and contrast of more than 200 starspots. We find that the flux ratio of spots ranges at least from 0.6 to 0.9, corresponding to an effective temperature approximately 100-450 K lower than the stellar surface, although it is possible that some spots are darker than 0.5. The largest detected spots have a radius less than approximately 0.2 stellar radii.},

	Abstract = {The characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres has come of age in the past decade, as astronomical techniques now allow for albedos, chemical abundances, temperature profiles and maps, rotation periods, and even wind speeds to be measured. Atmospheric dynamics sets the background state of density, temperature, and velocity that determines or influences the spectral and temporal appearance of an exoplanetary atmosphere. Hot exoplanets are most amenable to these characterization techniques. In this review, we focus on highly irradiated, large exoplanets (the hot Jupiters), as astronomical data begin to confront theoretical questions. We summarize the basic atmospheric quantities inferred from the astronomical observations. We review the state of the art by addressing a series of current questions, and look toward the future by considering a separate set of exploratory questions. Attaining the next level of understanding requires a concerted effort of constructing multifaceted, multiwavelength datasets for benchmark objects. Understanding clouds presents a formidable obstacle, as they introduce degeneracies into the interpretation of spectra, yet their properties and existence are directly influenced by atmospheric dynamics. Confronting general circulation models with these multifaceted, multiwavelength datasets will help us understand these and other degeneracies.},

	Abstract = {The formation mechanisms of the ice giants Uranus and Neptune, and the origin of their elemental and isotopic compositions, have long been debated. The density of solids in the outer protosolar nebula is too low to explain their formation, and spectroscopic observations show that both planets are highly enriched in carbon, very poor in nitrogen, and the ices from which they originally formed might have had deuterium-to-hydrogen ratios lower than the predicted cometary value, unexplained properties that were observed in no other planets. Here, we show that all these properties can be explained naturally if Uranus and Neptune both formed at the carbon monoxide ice line. Due to the diffusive redistribution of vapors, this outer region of the protosolar nebula intrinsically has enough surface density to form both planets from carbon-rich solids but nitrogen-depleted gas, in abundances consistent with their observed values. Water-rich interiors originating mostly from transformed CO ices reconcile the D/H value of Uranus's and Neptune's building blocks with the cometary value. Finally, our scenario generalizes a well known hypothesis that Jupiter formed on an ice line (water snow line) for the two ice giants, and might be a first step toward generalizing this mechanism for other giant planets.},

	Abstract = {Kepler-56 is a multi-planet system containing two coplanar inner planets that are in orbits misaligned with respect to the spin axis of the host star, and an outer planet. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the broad distribution of spin-orbit angles among exoplanets, and these theories fall under two broad categories. The first is based on dynamical interactions in a multi-body system, while the other assumes that disk migration is the driving mechanism in planetary configuration and that the star (or disk) is titled with respect to the planetary plane. Here we show that the large observed obliquity of Kepler 56 system is consistent with a dynamical origin. In addition, we use observations by Huber et al. to derive the obliquity's probability distribution function, thus improving the constrained lower limit. The outer planet may be the cause of the inner planets' large obliquities, and we give the probability distribution function of its inclination, which depends on the initial orbital configuration of the planetary system. We show that even in the presence of precise measurement of the true obliquity, one cannot distinguish the initial configurations. Finally we consider the fate of the system as the star continues to evolve beyond the main sequence, and we find that the obliquity of the system will not undergo major variations as the star climbs the red giant branch. We follow the evolution of the system and find that the innermost planet will be engulfed in ~129 Myr. Furthermore we put an upper limit of ~155 Myr for the engulfment of the second planet. This corresponds to ~3% of the current age of the star.},

@article{Esteves:2015,
	Abstract = {We present a comprehensive analysis of planetary phase variations, including possible planetary light offsets, using eighteen quarters of data from the Kepler space telescope. Our analysis found fourteen systems with significant detections in each of the phase curve components: planet's phase function, secondary eclipse, Doppler boosting, and ellipsoidal variations. We model the full phase curve simultaneously, including primary and secondary transits, and derive albedos, day- and night-side temperatures and planet masses. Most planets manifest low optical geometric albedos (< 0.25), with the exception of Kepler-10b, Kepler-91b, and KOI-13b. We find that KOI-13b, with a small eccentricity of 0.0006 $\pm$ 0.0001, is the only planet for which an eccentric orbit is favored. We detect a third harmonic for HAT-P-7b for the first time, and confirm the third harmonic for KOI-13b reported in Esteves et al.: both could be due to their spin-orbit misalignments. For six planets, we report a planetary brightness peak offset from the substellar point: of those, the hottest two (Kepler-76b and HAT-P-7b) exhibit pre-eclipse shifts or on the evening-side, while the cooler four (Kepler-7b, Kepler-8b, Kepler-12b, and Kepler-41b) peak post-eclipse or on the morning-side. Our findings dramatically increase the number of Kepler planets with detected planetary light offsets, and provide the first evidence in the Kepler data for a correlation between the peak offset direction and the planet's temperature. Such a correlation could arise if thermal emission dominates light from hotter planets that harbor hot spots shifted toward the evening-side, as theoretically predicted, while reflected light dominates cooler planets with clouds on the planet's morning-side.},

@article{Faigler:2015,
	Abstract = {We analyzed the Kepler light curves of four transiting hot Jupiter systems---KOI-13, HAT-P-7, TrES-2, and Kepler-76, which show BEaming, Ellipsoidal, and Reflection (BEER) phase modulations. The mass of the four planets can be estimated from either the beaming or the ellipsoidal amplitude, given the mass and radius of their parent stars. For KOI-13, HAT-P-7, and Kepler-76 we find that the beaming-based planetary mass estimate is larger than the mass estimated from the ellipsoidal amplitude, consistent with previous studies. This apparent discrepancy may be explained by equatorial superrotation of the planet atmosphere, which induces an angle shift of the planet reflection/emission phase modulation, as was suggested for Kepler-76 in the first paper of this series. We propose a modified BEER model that supports superrotation, assuming either a Lambertian or geometric reflection/emission phase function, and provides a photometry-consistent estimate of the planetary mass. Our analysis shows that for Kepler-76 and HAT-P-7, the Lambertian superrotation BEER model is highly preferable over an unshifted null model, while for KOI-13 it is preferable only at a 1.4sigma level. For TrES-2 we do not find such preference. For all four systems the Lambertian superrotation model mass estimates are in excellent agreement with the planetary masses derived from, or constrained by, radial velocity measurements. This makes the Lambertian superrotation BEER model a viable tool for estimating the masses of hot Jupiters from photometry alone. We conclude that hot Jupiter superrotation may be a common phenomenon that can be detected in the visual light curves of Kepler.},

@article{Lebreton:2014b,
	Abstract = {Context. In the context of the space missions CoRoT, Kepler, Gaia, TESS, and PLATO, precise and accurate stellar ages, masses, and radii are of paramount importance. For instance, they are crucial for constraining scenarii of planetary formation and evolution.  Aims: We aim at quantifying how detailed stellar modelling can improve the accuracy and precision on age and mass of individual stars. To that end, we adopt a multifaceted approach where we carefully examine how the number of observational constraints as well as the uncertainties on observations and on model input physics affect the results of age-dating and weighing.  Methods: We modelled in detail the exoplanet host-star HD 52265, a main-sequence, solar-like oscillator that CoRoT observed for four months. We considered different sets of observational constraints (Hertzsprung-Russell data, metallicity, various sets of seismic constraints). For each case, we determined the age, mass, and properties of HD 52265 inferred from stellar models, and we quantified the impact of the model input physics and free parameters. We also compared model ages with ages derived by empirical methods or Hertzsprung-Russell diagram inversion.  Results: For our case study HD 52265, our seismic analysis provides an age A = 2.10-2.54 Gyr, a mass M = 1.14-1.32 M&sun;, and a radius R = 1.30-1.34 R&sun;, which corresponds to age, mass, and radius uncertainties of ~10, ~7, and ~1.5 per cent, respectively. These uncertainties account for observational errors and current state-of-the-art stellar model uncertainties. Our seismic study also provides constraints on surface convection properties through the mixing-length, which we find to be 12-15 per cent lower than the solar value. On the other hand, because of helium-mass degeneracy, the initial helium abundance is determined modulo the mass value. Finally, we evaluate the seismic mass of the exoplanet to be Mpsini = 1.17-1.26 MJupiter, much more precise than what can be derived by Hertzsprung-Russell diagram inversion.  Conclusions: We demonstrate that asteroseismology allows us to substantially improve the age accuracy that can be achieved with other methods. We emphasize that the knowledge of the mean properties of stellar oscillations - such as the large frequency separation - is not enough to derive accurate ages. We need precise individual frequencies to narrow the age scatter that is a result of the model input physics uncertainties. Further progress is required to better constrain the physics at work in stars and the stars helium content. Our results emphasize the importance of precise classical stellar parameters and oscillation frequencies such as will be obtained by the Gaia and PLATO missions.

	Abstract = {Context. We investigate the grain opacity kappagr in the atmosphere (outer radiative zone) of forming planets. This is important for the observed planetary mass-radius relationship since kappagr affects the primordial H/He envelope mass of low-mass planets and the critical core mass of giant planets.  Aims: The goal of this study is to derive a simple analytical model for kappagr and to explore its implications for the atmospheric structure and resulting gas accretion rate.  Methods: Our model is based on the comparison of the timescales of the most important microphysical processes. We consider grain settling in the Stokes and Epstein drag regime, growth by Brownian motion coagulation and differential settling, grain evaporation in hot layers, and grain advection due to the contraction of the envelope. With these timescales and the assumption of a radially constant grain flux, we derive the typical grain size, abundance, and opacity.  Results: We find that the dominating growth process is differential settling. In this regime, kappagr has a simple functional form; it is given as 27Q/ 8Hrho in the Epstein regime in the outer atmosphere and as 2Q/Hrho for Stokes drag in the deeper layers. Grain growth leads to a typical radial structure of kappagr with high ISM-like values in the outer layers but a strong decrease towards the deeper parts where kappagr becomes so low that the grain-free molecular opacities take over.  Conclusions: In agreement with earlier results, we find that kappagr is typically much lower than in the ISM. In retrospect, this suggests that classical giant planet formation models should have considered the grain-free case to be as equally meaningful as the full ISM opacity case. The equations also show that a higher dust input in the top layers does not strongly increase kappagr. This has two important implications. First, for the formation of giant planet cores via pebbles, there could be the adverse effect that pebbles tend to increase the grain input high in the atmosphere because of ablation. This could in principle increase the opacity, making giant planet formation difficult. Our study indicates that this potentially adverse effect is not important. Second, it means that a higher stellar [Fe/H] which presumably leads to a higher surface density of planetesimals only favors giant planet formation without being detrimental to it because of an increased kappagr. This corroborates the result that core accretion can explain the observed increase of the giant planet frequency with stellar [Fe/H].

	Abstract = {Comparisons between the planet populations around solar-type stars and those orbiting M dwarfs shed light on the possible dependence of planet formation and evolution on stellar mass. However, such analyses must control for other factors, i.e., metallicity, a stellar parameter that strongly influences the occurrence of gas giant planets. We obtained infrared spectra of 121 M dwarfs stars monitored by the California Planet Search and determined metallicities with an accuracy of 0.08 dex. The mean and standard deviation of the sample are -0.05 and 0.20 dex, respectively. We parameterized the metallicity dependence of the occurrence of giant planets on orbits with a period less than two years around solar-type stars and applied this to our M dwarf sample to estimate the expected number of giant planets. The number of detected planets (3) is lower than the predicted number (6.4), but the difference is not very significant (12% probability of finding as many or fewer planets). The three M dwarf planet hosts are not especially metal rich and the most likely value of the power-law index relating planet occurrence to metallicity is 1.06 dex per dex for M dwarfs compared to 1.80 for solar-type stars; this difference, however, is comparable to uncertainties. Giant planet occurrence around both types of stars allows, but does not necessarily require, a mass dependence of ~1 dex per dex. The actual planet-mass-metallicity relation may be complex, and elucidating it will require larger surveys like those to be conducted by ground-based infrared spectrographs and the Gaia space astrometry mission.},

	Abstract = {Most extrasolar planets have been detected by their influence on their parent star, typically either gravitationally (the Doppler method) or by the small dip in brightness as the planet blocks a portion of the star (the transit method). Therefore, the accuracy with which we know the masses and radii of extrasolar planets depends directly on how well we know those of the stars, the latter usually determined from the measured stellar surface gravity, log g. Recent work has demonstrated that the short-timescale brightness variations ("flicker") of stars can be used to measure log g to a high accuracy of ~0.1-0.2 dex. Here, we use flicker measurements of 289 bright (Kepmag < 13) candidate planet-hosting stars with T eff = 4500-6650 K to re-assess the stellar parameters and determine the resulting impact on derived planet properties. This re-assessment reveals that for the brightest planet-host stars, Malmquist bias contaminates the stellar sample with evolved stars: nearly 50% of the bright planet-host stars are subgiants. As a result, the stellar radii, and hence the radii of the planets orbiting these stars, are on average 20%-30% larger than previous measurements had suggested.},

Here we derive their temperatures and albedos, with an eye toward constraining models for the formation and evolution of such planets. Where there was overlap our results confirm parameters derived by previous studies, whereas we present new results for Kepler 1b-8b, 12b-15b, 17b, 40b, 41b, 43b, 44b, 76b, 77b, and 412b derived in a consistent manner. We also present light-curve analyses for Kepler 91b and Kepler 74b, which both show extra dimmings at times other than from the expected primary and secondary eclipses. Corrected for thermal emission, we find most of the massive planets from our sample to be low in albedo (< 0.1) with a few having higher albedo (>0.1).},

	Abstract = {We study thermal convection in a rotating fluid in order to better understand the properties of convection zones in rotating stars and planets. We first derive a mixing-length theory for rapidly rotating convection, arriving at the results of Stevenson via simple physical arguments. The theory predicts the properties of convection as a function of the imposed heat flux and rotation rate, independent of microscopic diffusivities. In particular, it predicts the mean temperature gradient, the rms velocity and temperature fluctuations, and the size of the eddies that dominate heat transport. We test all of these predictions with high resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of Boussinesq convection in a Cartesian box. The results agree remarkably well with the theory across more than two orders of magnitude in rotation rate. For example, the temperature gradient is predicted to scale as the rotation rate to the four-fifths power at fixed flux, and the simulations yield 0.75 $\pm$ 0.06. We conclude that the mixing-length theory is a solid foundation for understanding the properties of convection zones in rotating stars and planets.},

	Abstract = {Kepler-13Ab (= KOI-13.01) is a unique transiting hot Jupiter. It is one of very few known short-period planets orbiting a hot A-type star, making it one of the hottest planets currently known. The availability of Kepler data allows us to measure the planet's occultation (secondary eclipse) and phase curve in the optical, which we combine with occultations observed by warm Spitzer at 4.5 mum and 3.6 mum and a ground-based occultation observation in the Ks band (2.1 mum). We derive a day-side hemisphere temperature of 2750 $\pm$ 160 K as the effective temperature of a black body showing the same occultation depths. Comparing the occultation depths with one-dimensional planetary atmosphere models suggests the presence of an atmospheric temperature inversion. Our analysis shows evidence for a relatively high geometric albedo, A g = 0.33^{+0.04}_{-0.06}. While measured with a simplistic method, a high A g is supported also by the fact that the one-dimensional atmosphere models underestimate the occultation depth in the optical. We use stellar spectra to determine the dilution, in the four wide bands where occultation was measured, due to the visual stellar binary companion 1.''15 $\pm$ 0.''05 away. The revised stellar parameters measured using these spectra are combined with other measurements, leading to revised planetary mass and radius estimates of Mp = 4.94-8.09 M J and Rp = 1.406 $\pm$ 0.038 R J. Finally, we measure a Kepler midoccultation time that is 34.0 $\pm$ 6.9 s earlier than expected based on the midtransit time and the delay due to light-travel time and discuss possible scenarios.},

	Abstract = {Brown dwarf spectra contain a wealth of information about their molecular abundances, temperature structure, and gravity. We present a new data driven retrieval approach, previously used in planetary atmosphere studies, to extract the molecular abundances and temperature structure from brown dwarf spectra. The approach makes few a priori physical assumptions about the state of the atmosphere. The feasibility of the approach is first demonstrated on a synthetic brown dwarf spectrum. Given typical spectral resolutions, wavelength coverage, and noise, property precisions of tens of percent can be obtained for the molecular abundances and tens to hundreds of K on the temperature profile. The technique is then applied to the well-studied brown dwarf, Gl 570D. From this spectral retrieval, the spectroscopic radius is constrained to be 0.75-0.83 R J, log (g) to be 5.13-5.46, and T eff to be between 804 and 849 K. Estimates for the range of abundances and allowed temperature profiles are also derived. The results from our retrieval approach are in agreement with the self-consistent grid modeling results of Saumon et al. This new approach will allow us to address issues of compositional differences between brown dwarfs and possibly their formation environments, disequilibrium chemistry, and missing physics in current grid modeling approaches as well as a many other issues.},

@article{Barnes:2015,
	Abstract = {The determination of an exoplanet as rocky is critical for the assessment of planetary habitability. Observationally, the number of small-radius, transiting planets with accompanying mass measurements is insufficient for a robust determination of the transitional mass or radius. Theoretically, models predict that rocky planets can grow large enough to become gas giants when they reach ~10 MEarth, but the transitional mass remains unknown. Here I show how transit data, interpreted in the context of tidal theory, can reveal the critical radius that separates rocky and gaseous exoplanets. Standard tidal models predict that rocky exoplanets' orbits are tidally circularized much more rapidly than gaseous bodies', suggesting the former will tend to be found on circular orbits at larger semi-major axes than the latter. Well-sampled transits can provide a minimum eccentricity of the orbit, allowing a measurement of this differential circularization. I show that this effect should be present in the data from the Kepler spacecraft, but is not apparent. Instead, it appears that there is no evidence of tidal circularization at any planetary radius, probably because the publicly-available data, particularly the impact parameters, are not accurate enough. I also review the bias in the transit duration towards values that are smaller than that of planets on circular orbits, stressing that the azimuthal velocity of the planet determines the transit duration. The ensemble of Kepler planet candidates may be able to determine the critical radius between rocky and gaseous exoplanets, tidal dissipation as a function of planetary radius, and discriminate between tidal models.},

Instead of being the archetypal examples of planets, those of our Solar System are merely possible outcomes of planetary system formation and evolution, and conceivably not even terribly common outcomes (although this remains an open question). Here, we review the diverse range of interior structures that are known to, and speculated to, exist in exoplanetary systems -- from mostly degenerate objects that are more than 10 times as massive as Jupiter, to intermediate-mass Neptune-like objects with large cores and moderate hydrogen/helium envelopes, to rocky objects with roughly the mass of the Earth.},

	Abstract = {Planetary embryos embedded in gaseous protoplanetary disks undergo Type I orbital migration. Migration can be inward or outward depending on the local disk properties but, in general, only planets more massive than several M⊕ can migrate outward. Here we propose that an embryo's migration history determines whether it becomes a hot super-Earth or the core of a giant planet. Systems of hot super-Earths (or mini-Neptunes) form when embryos migrate inward and pile up at the inner edge of the disk. Giant planet cores form when inward-migrating embryos become massive enough to switch direction and migrate outward. We present simulations of this process using a modified N-body code, starting from a swarm of planetary embryos. Systems of hot super-Earths form in resonant chains with the innermost planet at or interior to the disk inner edge. Resonant chains are disrupted by late dynamical instabilities triggered by the dispersal of the gaseous disk. Giant planet cores migrate outward toward zero-torque zones, which move inward and eventually disappear as the disk disperses. Giant planet cores migrate inward with these zones and are stranded at ~1-5 AU. Our model reproduces several properties of the observed extra-solar planet populations. The frequency of giant planet cores increases strongly when the mass in solids is increased, consistent with the observed giant exoplanet - stellar metallicity correlation. The frequency of hot super-Earths is not a function of stellar metallicity, also in agreement with observations. Our simulations can reproduce the broad characteristics of the observed super-Earth population.},

	Abstract = {The core accretion theory for giant planet formation predicts enrichment of elemental abundances in planetary envelopes caused by runaway accretion of planetesimals, which is consistent with measured super-solar abundances of C, N, P, S, Xe, and Ar in Jupiter's atmosphere. However, the abundance of O, which is expected to be the most dominant constituent of planetesimals, is unknown for solar system giant planets, owing to the condensation of water in their ultra-cold atmospheres, thereby posing a key unknown in solar system formation. On the other hand, hundreds of extrasolar "hot Jupiters" are known with very high temperatures (>=1000 K), making them excellent targets to measure H2O abundances and, hence, oxygen in their atmospheres. We constrain the atmospheric H2O abundances in three hot Jupiters (HD 189733b, HD 209458b, and WASP-12b), spanning a wide temperature range (1200-2500 K), using their near-infrared transmission spectra obtained using the Wide Field Camera 3 instrument on board the Hubble Space Telescope. We report conclusive measurements of H2O in HD 189733b and HD 209458b, while that in WASP-12b is not well constrained by present data. The data allow nearly solar as well as significantly sub-solar abundances in HD 189733b and WASP-12b. However, for HD 209458b, we report the most precise H2O measurement in an exoplanet to date that suggests a ~20-135 × sub-solar H2O abundance. We discuss the implications of our results on the formation conditions of hot Jupiters and on the likelihood of clouds in their atmospheres. Our results highlight the critical importance of high-precision spectra of hot Jupiters for deriving their H2O abundances.},

	Abstract = {Context. Solar and extrasolar comets and extrasolar planets are the subject of numerous studies in order to determine their chemical composition and internal structure. In the case of planetesimals, their compositions are important as they govern in part the composition of future planets.  Aims: The present works aims at determining the chemical composition of icy planetesimals, believed to be similar to present day comets, formed in stellar systems of solar chemical composition. The main objective of this work is to provide valuable theoretical data on chemical composition for models of planetesimals and comets, and models of planet formation and evolution.  Methods: We have developed a model that calculates the composition of ices formed during the cooling of the stellar nebula. Coupled with a model of refractory element formation, it allows us to determine the chemical composition and mass ratio of ices to rocks in icy planetesimals throughout in the protoplanetary disc.  Results: We provide relationships for ice line positions (for different volatile species) in the disc, and chemical compositions and mass ratios of ice relative to rock for icy planetesimals in stellar systems of solar chemical composition. From an initial homogeneous composition of the nebula, a wide variety of chemical compositions of planetesimals were produced as a function of the mass of the disc and distance to the star. Ices incorporated in planetesimals are mainly composed of H2O, CO, CO2, CH3OH, and NH3. The ice/rock mass ratio is equal to 1 $\pm$ 0.5 in icy planetesimals following assumptions. This last value is in good agreement with observations of solar system comets, but remains lower than usual assumptions made in planet formation models, taking this ratio to be of 2-3.},

The volatile species incorporated in planets are mainly composed of H2O, CO, CO2, CH3OH, and NH3. Icy or ocean planets have systematically higher values of molecular abundances compared to giant and rocky planets. Gas giant planets are depleted in highly volatile molecules such as CH4, CO, and N2 compared to icy or ocean planets. The ice/rock mass ratio in icy or ocean and gas giant planets is, respectively, equal at maximum to 1.01 $\pm$ 0.33 and 0.8 $\pm$ 0.5, and is different from the usual assumptions made in planet formation models, which suggested this ratio to be 2-3. The C:O molar ratio in the atmosphere of gas giant planets is depleted by at least 30% compared to solar value.},

@article{Hedman:2014,
	Abstract = {In a previous paper, we developed tools which allowed us to confirm that several of the waves in Saturn's rings were likely generated by resonances with fundamental sectoral normal modes inside Saturn itself. Here we use these same tools to examine eight additional waves that are probably generated by structures inside the planet. One of these waves appears to be generated by a resonance with a fundamental sectoral normal mode with azimuthal harmonic number m = 10. If this attribution is correct, then the m = 10 mode must have a larger amplitude than the modes with m = 5-9, since the latter do not appear to generate strong waves. We also identify five waves with pattern speeds between 807$\,^{\circ}$ and 834$\,^{\circ}$ d-1. Since these pattern speeds are close to the planet's rotation rate, they probably are due to persistent gravitational anomalies within the planet. These waves are all found in regions of enhanced optical depth known as plateaux, but surprisingly the surface mass densities they yield are comparable to the surface mass densities of the background C-ring. Finally, one wave appears to be a one-armed spiral pattern whose rotation rate suggests it is generated by a resonance with a structure inside Saturn, but the nature of this perturbing structure remains unclear. Strangely, the resonant radius for this wave seems to be drifting inwards at an average rate of 0.8 km yr-1 over the last 30 yr, implying that the relevant planetary oscillation frequency has been steadily increasing.},

@article{Maxted:2015a,
	Abstract = {Context. Tidal interactions between planets and their host stars are not well understood, but may be an important factor in their formation, structure, and evolution. Previous studies suggest that these tidal interactions may be responsible for discrepancies between the ages of exoplanet host stars estimated using stellar models (isochronal age estimates) and age estimates based on the stars' rotation periods (gyrochronological age estimates). Recent improvements in our understanding of the rotational evolution of single stars and a substantial increase in the number of exoplanet host stars with accurate rotation period measurements make it worthwhile to revisit this question.  Aims: Our aim is to determine whether the gyrochronological age estimates for transiting exoplanet host stars with accurate rotation period measurements are consistent with their isochronal age estimates, and whether this is indicative of tidal interaction between the planets and their host stars.  Methods: We have compiled a sample of 28 transiting exoplanet host stars with measured rotation periods, including two stars (HAT-P-21 and WASP-5) for which the rotation period based on the light curve modulation is reported here for the first time. We use our recently developed Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method to determine the joint posterior distribution for the mass and age of each star in the sample. We extend our Bayesian method to include a calculation of the posterior distribution of the gyrochronological age estimate that accounts for the uncertainties in the mass and age, the strong correlation between these values, and the uncertainties in the mass-rotation-age calibration.  Results: The gyrochronological age estimate (taugyro) is significantly lower than the isochronal age estimate for about half of the stars in our sample. Tidal interactions between the star and planet are a reasonable explanation for this discrepancy in some cases, but not all. The distribution of taugyro values is evenly spread from very young ages up to a maximum value of a few Gyr, i.e. there is no obvious pile-up of stars at very low or very high values of taugyro as might be expected if some evolutionary or selection effect were biasing the age distribution of the stars in this sample. There is no clear correlation between taugyro and the strength of the tidal force on the star due to the innermost planet. There is clear evidence that the isochronal age estimates for some K-type stars are too high, and this may also be the case for some G-type stars. This may be the result of magnetic inhibition of convection. The densities of HAT-P-11 and WASP-84 are too high to be reproduced by any stellar models within the observed constraints on effective temperature and metallicity. These stars may have strongly enhanced helium abundances. There is currently no satisfactory explanation for the discrepancy between the young age for CoRoT-2 estimated from either gyrochronology or its high lithium abundance, and the extremely old age for its K-type stellar companion inferred from its very low X-ray flux.  Conclusions: There is now strong evidence that the gyrochronological age estimates for some transiting exoplanet host stars are significantly lower than the isochronal age estimates, but it is not always clear that this is good evidence for tidal interactions between the star and the planet.},

	Abstract = {There has been growing observational evidence for the presence of condensates in the atmospheres and/or comet-like tails of extrasolar planets. As a result, systematic and homogeneous tables of dust properties are useful in order to facilitate further observational and theoretical studies. In this paper we present calculations and analysis of non-isotropic phase functions, asymmetry parameter (mean cosine of the scattering angle), absorption and scattering opacities, single scattering albedos, equilibrium temperatures, and radiative accelerations of dust grains relevant for extrasolar planets. Our assumptions include spherical grain shape, Deirmendjian particle size distribution, and Mie theory. We consider several species: corundum/alumina, perovskite, olivines with 0 and 50 per cent iron content, pyroxenes with 0, 20, and 60 per cent iron content, pure iron, carbon at two different temperatures, water ice, liquid water, and ammonia. The presented tables cover the wavelength range of 0.2-500 mum and modal particle radii from 0.01 to 100 mum. Equilibrium temperatures and radiative accelerations assume irradiation by a non-blackbody source of light with temperatures from 7000 to 700 K seen at solid angles from 2pi to 10-6 sr. The tables are provided to the community together with a simple code which allows for an optional, finite, angular dimension of the source of light (star) in the phase function.},

@article{Valsecchi:2015,
	Abstract = {Many exoplanets have now been detected in orbits with ultra-short periods very close to the Roche limit. Building upon our previous work, we study the possibility that mass loss through Roche lobe overflow (RLO) may affect the evolution of these planets, and could possibly transform a hot Jupiter into a lower-mass planet (hot Neptune or super-Earth). We focus here on systems in which the mass loss occurs slowly (``stable mass transfer'' in the language of binary star evolution) and we compute their evolution in detail with the binary evolution code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics. We include the effects of tides, RLO, irradiation, and photo-evaporation (PE) of the planet, as well as the stellar wind and magnetic braking. Our calculations all start with a hot Jupiter close to its Roche limit, in orbit around a Sun-like star. The initial orbital decay and onset of RLO are driven by tidal dissipation in the star. We confirm that such a system can indeed evolve to produce lower-mass planets in orbits of a few days. The RLO phase eventually ends and, depending on the details of the mass transfer and on the planetary core mass, the orbital period can remain around a few days for several Gyr. The remnant planets have rocky cores and some amount of envelope material, which is slowly removed via PE at a nearly constant orbital period; these have properties resembling many of the observed super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. For these remnant planets, we also predict an anti-correlation between mass and orbital period; very low-mass planets (Mpl ≲ 5 M⊕) in ultra-short periods (Porb < 1 day) cannot be produced through this type of evolution.},

	Abstract = {The physical state and properties of silicates at conditions encountered in the cores of gas giants, ice giants, and of Earth-like exoplanets now discovered with masses up to several times the mass of the Earth remain mostly unknown. Here, we report on theoretical predictions of the properties of silica, SiO2, up to 4 TPa and about 20 000 K by using first principles molecular dynamics simulations based on density functional theory. For conditions found in the super Earths and in ice giants, we show that silica remains a poor electrical conductor up to 10 Mbar due to an increase in the Si-O coordination with pressure. For Jupiter and Saturn cores, we find that MgSiO3 silicate has not only dissociated into MgO and SiO2, as shown in previous studies, but that these two phases have likely differentiated to lead to a core made of liquid SiO2 and solid (Mg,Fe)O.},

	Abstract = {The atmosphere of a brown dwarf or extrasolar giant planet controls the spectrum of radiation emitted by the object and regulates its cooling over time. Although the study of these atmospheres has been informed by decades of experience modeling stellar and planetary atmospheres, the distinctive characteristics of these objects present unique challenges to forward modeling. In particular, complex chemistry arising from molecule-rich atmospheres, molecular opacity line lists (sometimes running to 10 billion absorption lines or more), multiple cloud-forming condensates, and disequilibrium chemical processes all combine to create a challenging task for any modeling effort. This review describes the process of incorporating these complexities into one-dimensional radiative-convective equilibrium models of substellar objects. We discuss the underlying mathematics as well as the techniques used to model the physics, chemistry, radiative transfer, and other processes relevant to understanding these atmospheres. The review focuses on methods for creating atmosphere models and briefly presents some comparisons of model predictions to data. Current challenges in the field and some comments on the future conclude the review.},

	Abstract = {Tidal dissipation in planetary interiors is one of the key physical mechanisms that drive the evolution of star-planet and planet-moon systems. Tidal dissipation in planets is intrinsically related to their internal structure. In particular, fluid and solid layers behave differently under tidal forcing. Therefore, their respective dissipation reservoirs have to be compared. In this work, we compute separately the contributions of the potential dense rocky/icy core and of the convective fluid envelope of gaseous giant planets, as a function of core size and mass. We demonstrate that in general both mechanisms must be taken into account.},

We do so using the example system Kepler-410 [1]. This is one of the brightest (V = 9.4) Kepler exoplanet host stars, containing a small (2.8 R⊕) transiting planet in a long orbit (17.8 days), and one or more additional non-transiting planets as indicated by transit timing variations. The validation of Kepler-410 (KOI-42) was complicated due to the presence of a companion star, and the planetary nature of the system was confirmed after analyzing a Spitzer transit observation as well as ground-based follow-up observations.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a new methodology to robustly determine the mass profile, as well as the overall distribution, of Local Group satellite galaxies. Specifically, we employ a statistical multilevel modelling technique, Bayesian hierarchical modelling, to simultaneously constrain the properties of individual Local Group Milky Way satellite galaxies and the characteristics of the Milky Way satellite population. We show that this methodology reduces the uncertainty in individual dwarf galaxy mass measurements up to a factor of a few for the faintest galaxies. We find that the distribution of Milky Way satellites inferred by this analysis, with the exception of the apparent lack of high-mass haloes, is consistent with the Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) paradigm. In particular, we find that both the measured relationship between the maximum circular velocity and the radius at this velocity, as well as the inferred relationship between the mass within 300 pc and luminosity, match the values predicted by LambdaCDM simulations for haloes with maximum circular velocities below 20 km s-1. Perhaps more striking is that this analysis seems to suggest a more cusped `average' halo shape that is shared by these galaxies. While this study reconciles many of the observed properties of the Milky Way satellite distribution with that of LambdaCDM simulations, we find that there is still a deficit of satellites with maximum circular velocities of 20-40 km s-1.},

@article{de-Wit:2015,
	Abstract = {With over 1800 planets discovered outside of the Solar System in the past two decades, the field of exoplanetology has broadened our perspective on planetary systems. Research priorities are now moving from planet detection to planet characterization. In this context, transiting exoplanets are of special interest due to the wealth of data made available by their orbital configuration. Here, I introduce two methods to gain new insights into the atmospheric and interior properties of exoplanets. The first method aims to map an exoplanet's atmosphere based on the scanning obtained while it is occulted by its host star. I introduce the basics of eclipse mapping, its caveats, and a framework to mitigate their effects via global analyses including transits, phase curves, and radial velocity measurements. I use this method to create the first 2D map and the first cloud map of an exoplanet for the hot-Jupiters HD189733b and Kepler-7b, respectively. Ultimately temperature, composition, and circulation patterns could be constrained in 3D, a significant asset for informing atmospheric models. The second method, MassSpec, aims to determine transiting planet masses and atmospheric properties solely from transmission spectra. Determination of an exoplanet's mass is key to understanding its basic properties, including its potential for supporting life. To date, mass constraints for exoplanets are mainly based on radial velocity measurements, which are not suited for planets with low masses, large semi-major axes, or those orbiting faint or active stars. I demonstrate that a planet's mass has to be accounted for by atmospheric retrieval methods to avoid biases and that JWST could determine the mass and atmospheric properties of half a dozen Earth-sized planets in their host's habitable zones over its lifetime, which could lead to the first identification of a habitable exoplanet.},

	Abstract = {We generalize the well-known mixtures of Gaussians approach to density estimation and the accompanying Expectation-Maximization technique for finding  the maximum likelihood parameters of the mixture to the case where each data point carries an individual d-dimensional uncertainty covariance and has unique missing data properties. This algorithm reconstructs the error-deconvolved or "underlying" distribution function common to all samples, even when the individual data points are samples from different distributions, obtained by convolving the underlying distribution with the heteroskedastic uncertainty distribution of the data point and projecting out the missing data directions. We show how this basic algorithm can be extended with conjugate priors on all of the model parameters and a "split-and-"erge- procedure designed to avoid local maxima of the likelihood. We demonstrate the full method by applying it to the problem of inferring the three-dimensional veloc!  ity distribution of stars near the Sun from noisy two-dimensional, transverse velocity measurements from the Hipparcos satellite.},

@article{Kelly:2007,
	Abstract = {I describe a Bayesian method to account for measurement errors in linear regression of astronomical data. The method allows for heteroscedastic and possibly correlated measurement errors and intrinsic scatter in the regression relationship. The method is based on deriving a likelihood function for the measured data, and I focus on the case when the intrinsic distribution of the independent variables can be approximated using a mixture of Gaussian functions. I generalize the method to incorporate multiple independent variables, nondetections, and selection effects (e.g., Malmquist bias). A Gibbs sampler is described for simulating random draws from the probability distribution of the parameters, given the observed data. I use simulation to compare the method with other common estimators. The simulations illustrate that the Gaussian mixture model outperforms other common estimators and can effectively give constraints on the regression parameters, even when the measurement errors dominate the observed scatter, source detection fraction is low, or the intrinsic distribution of the independent variables is not a mixture of Gaussian functions. I conclude by using this method to fit the X-ray spectral slope as a function of Eddington ratio using a sample of 39 z<~0.8 radio-quiet quasars. I confirm the correlation seen by other authors between the radio-quiet quasar X-ray spectral slope and the Eddington ratio, where the X-ray spectral slope softens as the Eddington ratio increases. IDL routines are made available for performing the regression.},

	Abstract = {The Kepler Mission has found thousands of planetary candidates with radii between 1 and 4 {{R}\oplus }. These planets have no analogues in our own solar system, providing an unprecedented opportunity to understand the range and distribution of planetary compositions allowed by planet formation and evolution. A precise mass measurement is usually required to constrain the possible composition of an individual super-Earth-sized planet, but these measurements are difficult and expensive to make for the majority of Kepler planet candidates (PCs). Fortunately, adopting a statistical approach helps us to address this question without them. In particular, we apply hierarchical Bayesian modeling to a subsample of Kepler PCs that is complete for P\lt 25 days and {{R}pl}\gt 1.2 {{R}\oplus } and draw upon interior structure models that yield radii largely independent of mass by accounting for the thermal evolution of a gaseous envelope around a rocky core. Assuming the envelope is dominated by hydrogen and helium, we present the current-day composition distribution of the sub-Neptune-sized planet population and find that H+He envelopes are most likely to be ~1% of these planets' total masses with an intrinsic scatter of $\pm$0.5 dex. We address the gaseous/rocky transition and illustrate how our results do not result in a one-to-one relationship between mass and radius for this sub-Neptune population; accordingly, dynamical studies that wish to use Kepler data must adopt a probabilistic approach to accurately represent the range of possible masses at a given radius.},

In recent years effective statistical methods for fitting power laws have been developed, but appropriate use of these techniques requires significant programming and statistical insight. In order to greatly decrease the barriers to using good statistical methods for fitting power law distributions, we developed the powerlaw Python package.

	Abstract = {No true extrasolar Earth analog is known. Hundreds of planets have been found around Sun-like stars that are either Earth-sized but on shorter periods, or else on year-long orbits but somewhat larger. Under strong assumptions, exoplanet catalogs have been used to make an extrapolated estimate of the rate at which Sun-like stars host Earth analogs. These studies are complicated by the fact that every catalog is censored by non-trivial selection effects and detection efficiencies, and every property (period, radius, etc.) is measured noisily. Here we present a general hierarchical probabilistic framework for making justified inferences about the population of exoplanets, taking into account survey completeness and, for the first time, observational uncertainties. We are able to make fewer assumptions about the distribution than previous studies; we only require that the occurrence rate density be a smooth function of period and radius (employing a Gaussian process). By applying our method to synthetic catalogs, we demonstrate that it produces more accurate estimates of the whole population than standard procedures based on weighting by inverse detection efficiency. We apply the method to an existing catalog of small planet candidates around G dwarf stars. We confirm a previous result that the radius distribution changes slope near Earth's radius. We find that the rate density of Earth analogs is about 0.02 (per star per natural logarithmic bin in period and radius) with large uncertainty. This number is much smaller than previous estimates made with the same data but stronger assumptions.},

	Abstract = {Standard maximum-likelihood estimators for binary-star and exoplanet eccentricities are biased high, in the sense that the estimated eccentricity tends to be larger than the true eccentricity. As with most non-trivial observables, a simple histogram of estimated eccentricities is not a good estimate of the true eccentricity distribution. Here, we develop and test a hierarchical probabilistic method for performing the relevant meta-analysis, that is, inferring the true eccentricity distribution, taking as input the likelihood functions for the individual star eccentricities, or samplings of the posterior probability distributions for the eccentricities (under a given, uninformative prior). The method is a simple implementation of a hierarchical Bayesian model; it can also be seen as a kind of heteroscedastic deconvolution. It can be applied to any quantity measured with finite precision---other orbital parameters, or indeed any astronomical measurements of any kind, including magnitudes, distances, or photometric redshifts---so long as the measurements have been communicated as a likelihood function or a posterior sampling.},

	Abstract = {Context. A large fraction of stars host one or multiple close-in super-Earth planets. There is an active debate about whether these planets formed in situ or at greater distances from the central star and migrated to their current position. It has been shown that part of their observed properties (e.g., eccentricity distribution) can be reproduced by N-body simulations of in situ formation starting with a population of protoplanets of high masses and neglecting the effects of the disk gas.  Aims: We plan to reassess the in situ formation of close-in super-Earths through more complete simulations.  Methods: We performed N-body simulations of a population of small planetary embryos and planetesimals that include the effects of disk-planet interactions (e.g., eccentricity damping, Type I migration). In addition, we also consider the accretion of a primitive atmosphere from a protoplanetary disk.  Results: We find that planetary embryos grow very quickly well before the gas dispersal, and thus undergo rapid inward migration, which means that one cannot neglect the effects of a gas disk when considering the in-situ formation of close-in super-Earths. Owing to their rapid inward migration, super-Earths reach a compact configuration near the disk's inner edge whose distribution of orbital parameters matches the observed close-in super-Earths population poorly. On the other hand, simulations including eccentricity damping, but no Type I migration, reproduce the observed distributions better. Including the accretion of an atmosphere does not help reproduce the bulk architecture of observations. Interestingly, we find that the massive embryos can migrate inside the disk edge while capturing only a moderately massive hydrogen/helium atmosphere. By this process they avoid becoming giant planets.  Conclusions: The bulk of close-in super-Earths cannot form in situ, unless Type I migration is suppressed in the entire disk inside 1 AU.},

	Abstract = {Some extrasolar giant planets in close orbits---``hot Jupiters''---exhibit larger radii than that of a passively cooling planet. The extreme irradiation {{L}eq} these hot Jupiters receive from their close in stars creates a thick isothermal layer in their envelopes, which slows down their convective cooling, allowing them to retain their inflated size for longer. This is still insufficient to explain the observed sizes of the most inflated planets. Some models invoke an additional power source, deposited deep in the planetʼs envelope. Here, we present an analytical model for the cooling of such irradiated and internally heated gas giants. We show that a power source {{L}dep}, deposited at an optical depth {{tau }dep}, creates an exterior convective region, between optical depths {{L}eq}/{{L}dep} and {{tau }dep}, beyond which a thicker isothermal layer exists, which in extreme cases may extend to the center of the planet. This convective layer, which occurs only for {{L}dep}{{tau }dep}\gt {{L}eq}, further delays the cooling of the planet. Such a planet is equivalent to a planet irradiated with {{L}eq}{{(1+{{L}dep}{{tau }dep}/{{L}eq})}beta }, where beta ≈ 0.35 is an effective power-law index describing the radiative energy density as a function of the optical depth for a convective planet U\propto {{tau }beta }. Our simple analytical model reproduces the main trends found in previous numerical works and provides an intuitive understanding. We derive scaling laws for the cooling rate of the planet, its central temperature, and radius. These scaling laws can be used to estimate the effects of tidal or Ohmic dissipation, wind shocks, or any other mechanism involving energy deposition on the sizes of hot Jupiters.},

	Abstract = {The statistics of extrasolar planetary systems indicate that the default mode of planet formation generates planets with orbital periods shorter than 100 days, and masses substantially exceeding that of the Earth. When viewed in this context, the Solar System is unusual. Here, we present simulations which show that a popular formation scenario for Jupiter and Saturn, in which Jupiter migrates inward from a > 5 AU to a ~ 1.5 AU before reversing direction, can explain the low overall mass of the Solar System's terrestrial planets, as well as the absence of planets with a < 0.4 AU. Jupiter's inward migration entrained s ~ 10-100 km planetesimals into low-order mean-motion resonances, shepherding and exciting their orbits. The resulting collisional cascade generated a planetesimal disk that, evolving under gas drag, would have driven any pre-existing short-period planets into the Sun. In this scenario, the Solar System's terrestrial planets formed from gas-starved mass-depleted debris that remained after the primary period of dynamical evolution.},

We model the core as a uniform, incompressible, elastic solid, and the envelope as a non-viscous fluid satisfying the n = 1 polytropic equation of state. We discuss how the Love numbers depend on the size, density, and shear modulus of the core. We then model the core as a viscoelastic Maxwell solid and compute the tidal dissipation rate in the planet as characterized by the imaginary part of the Love number k2. Our results improve upon existing calculations based on planetary models with a solid core and a uniform (n = 0) envelope. Our analytical expressions for the Love numbers can be applied to study tidal distortion and viscoelastic dissipation of giant planets with solid cores of various rheological properties, and our general method can be extended to study tidal distortion/dissipation of super-Earths.},

@article{Schwarz:2015,
	Abstract = {Context. Broadband secondary-eclipse measurements of strongly irradiated hot Jupiters have indicated the existence of atmospheric thermal inversions, but their presence is difficult to determine from broadband measurements because of degeneracies between molecular abundances and temperature structure. Furthermore, the primary mechanisms that drive the inversion layers in hot-Jupiter atmospheres are unknown. This question cannot be answered without reliable identification of thermal inversions.  Aims: We apply high-resolution (R = 100 000) infrared spectroscopy to probe the temperature-pressure profile of HD 209458b. This bright, transiting hot-Jupiter has long been considered the gold standard for a hot Jupiter with an inversion layer, but this has been challenged in recent publications.  Methods: We observed the thermal dayside emission of HD 209458b with the CRyogenic Infra-Red Echelle Spectrograph (CRIRES) on the Very Large Telescope during three nights, targeting the carbon monoxide band at 2.3 mum. Thermal inversions give rise to emission features, which means that detecting emission lines in the planetary spectrum, as opposed to absorption lines, would be direct evidence of a region in which the temperature increases with altitude.  Results: We do not detect any significant absorption or emission of CO in the dayside spectrum of HD 209458b, although cross-correlation with template spectra either with CO absorption lines or with weak emission at the core of the lines show a low-significance correlation signal with asignal - to - noiseratioof ~3-3.5. Models with strong CO emission lines show a weak anti-correlation with similar or lower significance levels. Furthermore, we found no evidence of absorption or emission from H2O at these wavelengths.  Conclusions: The non-detection of CO in the dayside spectrum of HD 209458b is interesting in light of a previous CO detection in the transmission spectrum. That there is no signal indicates that HD 209458b either has a nearly isothermal atmosphere or that the signal is heavily muted. Assuming a clear atmosphere, we can rule out a full-disc dayside inversion layer in the pressure range 1 bar to 1 mbar.

	Abstract = {A planet's magnetosheath extends from downstream of its bow shock up to the magnetopause, where the solar wind flow is deflected around the magnetosphere and the solar wind-embedded magnetic field lines are draped. This makes the region an important site for plasma turbulence, instabilities, reconnection, and plasma depletion layers. A relatively high Alfv{\'e}n Mach number solar wind and a polar-flattened magnetosphere make the magnetosheath of Saturn both physically and geometrically distinct from the Earth's. The polar flattening is predicted to affect the magnetosheath magnetic field structure and thus the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction. Here we investigate the magnetic field in the magnetosheath with the expectation that polar flattening is manifested in the overall draping pattern. We compare an accumulation of Cassini data between 2004 and 2010 with global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and an analytical model representative of a draped field between axisymmetric boundaries. The draping patterns measured are well captured and in broad agreement for given upstream conditions with those of the MHD simulations (which include polar flattening). The deviations from the analytical model, based on no polar flattening, suggest that nonaxisymmetry is invariably a key feature of the magnetosphere's global structure. Our results show a comprehensive overview of the configuration of the magnetic field in a nonaxisymmetric magnetosheath as revealed by Cassini. We anticipate our assessment to provide an insight to this barely studied interface between a high Alfv{\'e}nic bow shock and a dynamic magnetosphere.},

	Abstract = {The primordial internal structures of gas giant planets are unknown. Often giant planets are modeled under the assumption that they are adiabatic, convective, and homogeneously mixed, but this is not necessarily correct. In this work, we present the first self-consistent calculation of convective transport of both heat and material as the planets evolve. We examine how planetary evolution depends on the initial composition and its distribution, whether the internal structure changes with time, and if so, how it affects the evolution. We consider various primordial distributions, different compositions, and different mixing efficiencies and follow the distribution of heavy elements in a Jupiter-mass planet as it evolves. We show that a heavy-element core cannot be eroded by convection if there is a sharp compositional change at the core-envelope boundary. If the heavy elements are initially distributed within the planet according to some compositional gradient, mixing occurs in the outer regions resulting in a compositionally homogeneous outer envelope. Mixing of heavy materials that are injected in a convective gaseous envelope are found to mix efficiently. Our work demonstrates that the primordial internal structure of a giant planet plays a substantial role in determining its long-term evolution and that giant planets can have non-adiabatic interiors. These results emphasize the importance of coupling formation, evolution, and internal structure models of giant planets self-consistently.},

	Abstract = {Kepler-93b is a 1.478 $\pm$ 0.019 R ⊕ planet with a 4.7 day period around a bright (V = 10.2), astroseismically characterized host star with a mass of 0.911 $\pm$ 0.033 M &sun; and a radius of 0.919 $\pm$ 0.011 R &sun;. Based on 86 radial velocity observations obtained with the HARPS-N spectrograph on the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo and 32 archival Keck/HIRES observations, we present a precise mass estimate of 4.02 $\pm$ 0.68 M ⊕. The corresponding high density of 6.88 $\pm$ 1.18 g cm-3 is consistent with a rocky composition of primarily iron and magnesium silicate. We compare Kepler-93b to other dense planets with well-constrained parameters and find that between 1 and 6 M ⊕, all dense planets including the Earth and Venus are well-described by the same fixed ratio of iron to magnesium silicate. There are as of yet no examples of such planets with masses >6 M ⊕. All known planets in this mass regime have lower densities requiring significant fractions of volatiles or H/He gas. We also constrain the mass and period of the outer companion in the Kepler-93 system from the long-term radial velocity trend and archival adaptive optics images. As the sample of dense planets with well-constrained masses and radii continues to grow, we will be able to test whether the fixed compositional model found for the seven dense planets considered in this paper extends to the full population of 1-6 M ⊕ planets.  Based on observations made with the Italian Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) operated on the island of La Palma by the Fundaci{\'o}n Galileo Galilei of the INAF (Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica) at the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias.},

	Abstract = {We present an improved estimate of the occurrence rate of small planets orbiting small stars by searching the full four-year Kepler data set for transiting planets using our own planet detection pipeline and conducting transit injection and recovery simulations to empirically measure the search completeness of our pipeline. We identified 156 planet candidates, including one object that was not previously identified as a Kepler Object of Interest. We inspected all publicly available follow-up images, observing notes, and centroid analyses, and corrected for the likelihood of false positives. We evaluated the sensitivity of our detection pipeline on a star-by-star basis by injecting 2000 transit signals into the light curve of each target star. For periods shorter than 50 days, we find {0.56}-0.05+0.06 Earth-size planets (1-1.5 R⊕) and {0.46}-0.05+0.07 super-Earths (1.5-2 R⊕) per M dwarf. In total, we estimate a cumulative planet occurrence rate of 2.5 $\pm$ 0.2 planets per M dwarf with radii 1-4 R⊕ and periods shorter than 200 days. Within a conservatively defined habitable zone (HZ) based on the moist greenhouse inner limit and maximum greenhouse outer limit, we estimate an occurrence rate of {0.16}-0.07+0.17 Earth-size planets and {0.12}-0.05+0.10 super-Earths per M dwarf HZ. Adopting the broader insolation boundaries of the recent Venus and early Mars limits yields a higher estimate of {0.24}-0.08+0.18 Earth-size planets and {0.21}-0.06+0.11 super-Earths per M dwarf HZ. This suggests that the nearest potentially habitable non-transiting and transiting Earth-size planets are 2.6 $\pm$ 0.4 pc and {10.6}-1.8+1.6 pc away, respectively. If we include super-Earths, these distances diminish to 2.1 $\pm$ 0.2 pc and {8.6}-0.8+0.7 pc.},

@article{Piso:2015,
	Abstract = {Giant planet formation by core accretion requires a core that is sufficiently massive to trigger runaway gas accretion in less than the typical lifetime of protoplanetary disks. We explore how the minimum required core mass, M crit, depends on a non-ideal equation of state (EOS) and on opacity changes due to grain growth across a range of stellocentric distances from 5-100 AU. This minimum M crit applies when planetesimal accretion does not substantially heat the atmosphere. Compared to an ideal gas polytrope, the inclusion of molecular hydrogen (H2) dissociation and variable occupation of H2 rotational states increases M crit. Specifically, M crit increases by a factor of ~2 if the H2 spin isomers, ortho- and parahydrogen, are in thermal equilibrium, and by a factor of ~2-4 if the ortho-to-para ratio is fixed at 3:1. Lower opacities due to grain growth reduce M crit. For a standard disk model around a Solar mass star, we calculate M crit ~ 8 M ⊕ at 5 AU, decreasing to ~5 M ⊕ at 100 AU, for a realistic EOS with an equilibrium ortho-to-para ratio and for grain growth to centimeter-sizes. If grain coagulation is taken into account, M crit may further reduce by up to one order of magnitude. These results for the minimum critical core mass are useful for the interpretation of surveys that find exoplanets at a range of orbital distances.},

@article{Reffert:2015,
	Abstract = {Context. We have obtained precise radial velocities for a sample of 373 G and K type giants at Lick Observatory regularly over more than 12 years. Planets have been identified around 15 of these giant stars, and an additional 20 giant stars host planet candidates.  Aims: We are interested in the occurrence rate of substellar companions around giant stars as a function of stellar mass and metallicity. We probe the stellar mass range from approximately 1 to beyond 3 M&sun;, which is not being explored by main-sequence samples.  Methods: We fit the giant planet occurrence rate as a function of stellar mass and metallicity with a Gaussian and an exponential distribution, respectively.  Results: We find strong evidence for a planet-metallicity correlation among the secure planet hosts of our giant star sample, in agreement with the one for main-sequence stars. However, the planet-metallicity correlation is absent for our sample of planet candidates, raising the suspicion that a good fraction of them might indeed not be planets despite clear periodicities in the radial velocities. Consistent with the literature results for subgiants, the giant planet occurrence rate increases in the stellar mass interval from 1 to 1.9 M&sun;. However, there is a maximum at a stellar mass of 1.9+ 0.1-0.5 M&sun;, and the occurrence rate drops rapidly for masses larger than 2.5-3.0 M&sun;. We do not find any planets around stars more massive than 2.7 M&sun;, although there are 113 stars with masses between 2.7 and 5 M&sun; in our sample (corresponding to a giant planet occurrence rate smaller than 1.6% at 68.3% confidence in that stellar mass bin). We also show that this result is not a selection effect related to the planet detectability being a function of the stellar mass.  Conclusions: We conclude that giant planet formation or inward migration is suppressed around higher mass stars, possibly because of faster disk depletion coupled with a longer migration timescale.  Based on observations collected at Lick Observatory, University of California.Table 3 is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/574/A116},

	Abstract = {Jupiter's atmosphere has been observed to be depleted in helium (Yatm ˜ 0.24), suggesting active helium sedimentation in the interior. This is accounted for in standard Jupiter structure and evolution models through the assumption of an outer, He-depleted envelope that is separated from the He-enriched deep interior by a sharp boundary. Here we aim to develop a model for Jupiter's inhomogeneous thermal evolution that relies on a more self-consistent description of the internal profiles of He abundance, temperature, and heat flux. We make use of recent numerical simulations on H/He demixing, and on layered double diffusive (LDD) and oscillatory double diffusive (ODD) convection, and assume an idealized planet model composed of an H/He envelope and a massive core. A general framework for the construction of interior models with He rain is described. Despite, or perhaps because of, our simplifications made we find that self-consistent models are rare. For instance, no model for ODD convection is found. We modify the H/He phase diagram of Lorenzen et al. to reproduce Jupiter's atmospheric helium abundance and examine evolution models as a function of the LDD layer height, from those that prolong Jupiter's cooling time to those that actually shorten it. Resulting models that meet the luminosity constraint have layer heights of ≈0.1-1 km, corresponding to ≈10 000-20 000 layers in the rain zone between ˜1 and 3-4.5 Mbar. Present limitations and directions for future work are discussed, such as the formation and sinking of He droplets.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We assess the importance of tidal evolution and its interplay with magnetic braking in the population of hot-Jupiter planetary systems.  Methods: By minimizing the total mechanical energy of a given system under the constraint of stellar angular momentum loss, we rigorously find the conditions for the existence of dynamical equilibrium states. We estimate their duration, in particular when the wind torque spinning down the star is almost compensated for by the tidal torque spinning it up. We introduce dimensionless variables to characterize the tidal evolution of observed hot Jupiter systems and discuss their spin and orbital states using generalized Darwin diagrams based on our new approach.  Results: We show that their orbital properties are related to the effective temperature of their host stars. The long-term evolution of planets orbiting F- and G-type stars is significantly different owing to the combined effect of magnetic braking and tidal dissipation. The existence of a quasi-stationary state, in the case of short-period planets, can significantly delay their tidal evolution that would otherwise bring the planet to fall into its host star. Most of the planets known to orbit F-type stars are presently found to be near this stationary state, probably in a configuration not too far from what they had when their host star settled on the zero-age main sequence. Considering the importance of angular momentum loss in the early stages of stellar evolution, our results indicate that it has to be considered to properly test the migration scenarios of planetary system formation.

@article{Showman:2014,
	Abstract = {Efforts to characterize extrasolar giant planet (EGP) atmospheres have so far emphasized planets within 0.05 AU of their stars. Despite this focus, known EGPs populate a continuum of orbital separations from canonical hot Jupiter values (0.03-0.05 AU) out to 1 AU and beyond. Unlike typical hot Jupiters, these more distant EGPs will not in general be synchronously rotating. In anticipation of observations of this population, we here present three-dimensional atmospheric circulation models exploring the dynamics that emerge over a broad range of rotation rates and incident stellar fluxes appropriate for warm and hot Jupiters. We find that the circulation resides in one of two basic regimes. On typical hot Jupiters, the strong day-night heating contrast leads to a broad, fast superrotating (eastward) equatorial jet and large day-night temperature differences. At faster rotation rates and lower incident fluxes, however, the day-night heating gradient becomes less important, and baroclinic instabilities emerge as a dominant player, leading to eastward jets in the midlatitudes, minimal temperature variations in longitude, and, in many cases, weak winds at the equator. Our most rapidly rotating and least irradiated models exhibit multiple eastward jets in each hemisphere--similar to the jets on Jupiter and Saturn--and illuminate the dynamical continuum between highly irradiated EGPs and the weakly irradiated giant planets of our own Solar System. We present infrared (IR) light curves and spectra of these models, which show that the amplitude and offset of the IR phase variation, as well as the shape of the spectra, depend significantly on incident flux and rotation rate. This provides a way to identify the regime transition in future observations and suggests that, in some cases, IR light curves can provide constraints on the rotation rate of non-synchronously rotating planets.},

	Abstract = {We present new equations of state (EOSs) for hydrogen and helium covering a wide range of temperatures from 60 K to 107 K and densities from 10-10 g cm-3 to 103 g cm-3. They include an extended set of ab initio EOS data for the strongly correlated quantum regime with an accurate connection to data derived from other approaches for the neighboring regions. We compare linear mixing isotherms based on our EOS tables with available real mixture data. A first important astrophysical application of this new EOS data is the calculation of interior models for Jupiter and comparison with recent results. Second, mass-radius relations are calculated for Brown Dwarfs (BDs) which we compare with predictions derived from the widely used EOS of Saumon, Chabrier, and van Horn. Furthermore, we calculate interior models for typical BDs with different masses, namely, Corot-3b, Gliese-229b, and Corot-15b, and the giant planet KOI-889b. The predictions for the central pressures and densities differ by up to 10% dependent on the EOS used. Our EOS tables are made available in the supplemental material of this paper.},

	Abstract = {Planets orbiting very close to their host stars have been found, some of them on the verge of tidal disruption. The ellipsoidal shape of these planets can significantly differ from a sphere, which modifies the transit light curves. Here we present an easy method for taking the effect of the tidal bulge into account in the transit photometric observations. We show that the differences in the light curve are greater than previously thought. When detectable, these differences provide an estimation of the fluid Love number, which is invaluable information on the internal structure of close-in planets. We also derive a simple analytical expression to correct the bulk density of these bodies, that can be 20% smaller than current estimates obtained assuming a spherical radius.

	Abstract = {Seismology applied to giant planets could drastically change our understanding of their deep interiors, as it has happened with the Earth, the Sun, and many main-sequence and evolved stars. The study of giant planets' composition is important for understanding both the mechanisms enabling their formation and the origins of planetary systems, in particular our own. Unfortunately, its determination is complicated by the fact that their interior is thought not to be homogeneous, so that spectroscopic determinations of atmospheric abundances are probably not representative of the planet as a whole. Instead, the determination of their composition and structure must rely on indirect measurements and interior models. Giant planets are mostly fluid and convective, which makes their seismology much closer to that of solar-like stars than that of terrestrial planets. Hence, helioseismology techniques naturally transfer to giant planets. In addition, two alternative methods can be used: photometry of the solar light reflected by planetary atmospheres, and ring seismology in the specific case of Saturn. The current decade has been promising thanks to the detection of Jupiter's acoustic oscillations with the ground-based imaging-spectrometer SYMPA and indirect detection of Saturn's f-modes in its rings by the NASA Cassini orbiter. This has motivated new projects of ground-based and space-borne instruments that are under development. The purpose of this paper is to support the chapter Seismology of Giant Planets which will appear in May 2015 in the book Extraterrestrial Seismology, published in Cambridge University Press. Here, we review the key questions about jovian interiors as well as the most recent observational results, and refer the reader to the book chapter above-mentioned for further details.},

	Abstract = {A long and thorough investigation of chemical abundances of planet-hosting stars that lasted for more than a decade has finally beared fruit. We explore a sample of 148 solar-like stars to search for a possible correlation between the slopes of the abundance trends versus condensation temperature (known as the T_{c} slope) both with stellar parameters and Galactic orbital parameters in order to understand the nature of the peculiar chemical signatures of these stars and the possible connection with planet formation. We find that the T_{c} slope correlates at a significant level (at more than 4sigma) with the stellar age and the stellar surface gravity. We also find tentative evidence that the T_{c} slope correlates with the mean galactocentric distance of the stars (R_{mean}), suggesting that stars that originated in the inner Galaxy have fewer refractory elements relative to the volatile ones. We found that the chemical ``peculiarities'' (small refractory-to-volatile ratio) of planet-hosting stars is merely a reflection of their older age and their inner Galaxy origin. We conclude that the stellar age and probably Galactic birth place are key to establish the abundances of some specific elements.},

@article{Jofre:2015,
	Abstract = {Aims: We present fundamental stellar parameters, chemical abundances, and rotational velocities for a sample of 86 evolved stars with planets (56 giants; 30 subgiants), and for a control sample of 137 stars (101 giants; 36 subgiants) without planets. The analysis was based on both high signal-to-noise and resolution echelle spectra. The main goals of this work are i) to investigate chemical differences between evolved stars that host planets and those of the control sample without planets; ii) to explore potential differences between the properties of the planets around giants and subgiants; and iii) to search for possible correlations between these properties and the chemical abundances of their host stars. Implications for the scenarios of planet formation and evolution are also discussed.  Methods: The fundamental stellar parameters (Teff, log g, [Fe/H], xit) were computed homogeneously using the FUNDPAR code. The chemical abundances of 14 elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, and Ba) were obtained using the MOOG code. Rotational velocities were derived from the full width at half maximum of iron isolated lines.  Results: In agreement with previous studies, we find that subgiants with planets are, on average, more metal-rich than subgiants without planets by ~0.16 dex. The [Fe/H] distribution of giants with planets is centered at slightly subsolar metallicities and there is no metallicity enhancement relative to the [Fe/H] distribution of giants without planets. Furthermore, contrary to recent results, we do not find any clear difference between the metallicity distributions of stars with and without planets for giants with M*> 1.5 M&sun;. With regard to the other chemical elements, the analysis of the [X/Fe] distributions shows differences between giants with and without planets for some elements, particularly V, Co, and Ba. Subgiants with and without planets exhibit similar behavior for most of the elements. On the other hand, we find no evidence of rapid rotation among the giants with planets or among the giants without planets. Finally, analyzing the planet properties, some interesting trends might be emerging: i) multi-planet systems around evolved stars show a slight metallicity enhancement compared with single-planet systems; ii) planets with a ≲ 0.5 AU orbit subgiants with [Fe/H] > 0 and giants hosting planets with a ≲ 1 AU have [Fe/H] < 0; iii) higher-mass planets tend to orbit more metal-poor giants with M* <= 1.5 M&sun;, whereas planets around subgiants seem to follow the planet-mass metallicity trend observed on dwarf hosts; iv) [X/Fe] ratios for Na, Si, and Al seem to increase with the mass of planets around giants; v) planets orbiting giants show lower orbital eccentricities than those orbiting subgiants and dwarfs, suggesting a more efficient tidal circularization or the result of the engulfment of close-in planets with larger eccentricities.  Based on spectral data retrieved from the ELODIE and SOPHIE archives at Observatoire de Haute-Provence (Moultaka et al. 2004).Based on data obtained from the ESO Science Archive Facility collected at the La Silla Paranal Observatory, ESO (Chile) with the HARPS and FEROS spectrographs.},

@article{Yildiz:2014,
	Abstract = {It is already stated in the previous studies that the radius of the giant planets is affected by stellar irradiation. The confirmed relation between radius and incident flux depends on planetary mass intervals. In this study, we show that there is a single relation between radius and irradiated energy per gram per second (l-), for all mass intervals. There is an extra increase in radius of planets if l- is higher than 1100 times energy received by the Earth (l⊕). This is likely due to dissociation of molecules. The tidal interaction as a heating mechanism is also considered and found that its maximum effect on the inflation of planets is about 15 per cent. We also compute age and heavy element abundances from the properties of host stars, given in the TEPCat catalogue (Southworth 2011). The metallicity given in the literature is as [Fe/H]. However, the most abundant element is oxygen, and there is a reverse relation between the observed abundances [Fe/H] and [O/Fe]. Therefore, we first compute [O/H] from [Fe/H] by using observed abundances, and then find heavy element abundance from [O/H]. We also develop a new method for age determination. Using the ages we find, we analyse variation of both radius and mass of the planets with respect to time, and estimate the initial mass of the planets from the relation we derive for the first time. According to our results, the highly irradiated gas giants lose 5 per cent of their mass in every 1 Gyr.},

	Abstract = {We present the radial-velocity follow-up of two Kepler planetary transiting candidates (KOI-189 and KOI-686) carried out with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the Observatoire de Haute Provence. These data promptly discard these objects as viable planet candidates and show that the transiting objects are in the regime of very low-mass stars, where a strong discrepancy between observations and models persists for the mass and radius parameters. By combining the SOPHIE spectra with the Kepler light curve and photometric measurements found in the literature, we obtain a full characterization of the transiting companions, their orbits, and their host stars. The two companions are in significantly eccentric orbits with relatively long periods (30 days and 52.5 days), which makes them suitable objects for a comparison with theoretical models, since the effects invoked to understand the discrepancy with observations are weaker for these orbital distances. KOI-189 b has a mass M = 0.0745 $\pm$ 0.0033 M&sun; and a radius R = 0.1025 $\pm$ 0.0024 R&sun;. The density of KOI-189 b is significantly lower than expected from theoretical models for a system of its age. We explore possible explanations for this difference. KOI-189 b is the smallest hydrogen-burning star with such a precise determination of its fundamental parameters. KOI-686 b is larger and more massive (M = 0.0915 $\pm$ 0.0043 M&sun;; R = 0.1201 $\pm$ 0.0033 R&sun;), and its position in the mass-radius diagram agrees well with theoretical expectations.

@article{Liu:2015,
	Abstract = {We consider the origin of compact, short-period, Jupiter-mass planets. We propose that their diverse structure is caused by giant impacts of embryos and super-Earths or mergers with other gas giants during the formation and evolution of these hot Jupiters. Through a series of numerical simulations, we show that typical head-on collisions generally lead to total coalescence of impinging gas giants. Although extremely energetic collisions can disintegrate the envelope of gas giants, these events seldom occur. During oblique and moderately energetic collisions, the merger products retain higher fraction of the colliders' cores than their envelopes. They can also deposit considerable amount of spin angular momentum to the gas giants and desynchronize their spins from their orbital mean motion. We find that the oblateness of gas giants can be used to infer the impact history. Subsequent dissipation of stellar tide inside the planets' envelope can lead to runaway inflation and potentially a substantial loss of gas through Roche lobe overflow. The impact of super-Earths on parabolic orbits can also enlarge gas giant planets' envelope and elevates their tidal dissipation rate over ˜100 Myr time scale. Since giant impacts occur stochastically with a range of impactor sizes and energies, their diverse outcomes may account for the dispersion in the mass-radius relationship of hot Jupiters.},

	Abstract = {Studying exoplanets with their parent stars is crucial to understand their population, formation and history. We review some of the key questions regarding their evolution with particular emphasis on giant gaseous exoplanets orbiting close to solar-type stars. For masses above that of Saturn, transiting exoplanets have large radii indicative of the presence of a massive hydrogen-helium envelope. Theoretical models show that this envelope progressively cools and contracts with a rate of energy loss inversely proportional to the planetary age. The combined measurement of planetary mass, radius and a constraint on the (stellar) age enables a global determination of the amount of heavy elements present in the planet interior. The comparison with stellar metallicity shows a correlation between the two, indicating that accretion played a crucial role in the formation of planets. The dynamical evolution of exoplanets also depends on the properties of the central star. We show that the lack of massive giant planets and brown dwarfs in close orbit around G-dwarfs and their presence around F-dwarfs are probably tied to the different properties of dissipation in the stellar interiors. Both the evolution and the composition of stars and planets are intimately linked.},

	Abstract = {Context. Tidal dissipation, which is directly linked to internal structure, is one of the key physical mechanisms that drive the evolution of systems and govern their architecture. A robust evaluation of its amplitude is thus needed to predict the evolution time for spins and orbits and their final states.  Aims: The purpose of this paper is to refine a recent model of the anelastic tidal dissipation in the central dense region of giant planets, which are commonly assumed to retain a large amount of heavy elements, which constitute an important source of dissipation.  Methods: The previous paper evaluated the impact of the static fluid envelope on the tidal deformation of the core and on the associated anelastic tidal dissipation through the tidal quality factor Qc. We examine here its impact on the corresponding effective anelastic tidal dissipation through the effective tidal quality factor Qp.  Results: We show that the strength of this mechanism mainly depends on mass concentration. In the case of Jupiter- and Saturn-like planets, it can increase their effective tidal dissipation by, around, factors 2.4 and 2, respectively. In particular, the range of the rheologies compatible with the observations is enlarged compared to the results issued from previous formulations.  Conclusions: We derive here an improved expression of the tidal effective factor Qp in terms of the tidal dissipation factor of the core Qc, without assuming the commonly used assumptions. When applied to giant planets, the formulation obtained here allows a better match between the anelastic core's tidal dissipation of a two-layer model and the observations.},

	Abstract = {In the standard model of core accretion, the cores of the giant planets form by the accretion of planetesimals. In this scenario, the evolution of the planetesimal population plays an important role in the formation of massive cores. Recently, we studied the role of planetesimal fragmentation in the in situ formation of a giant planet. However, the exchange of angular momentum between the planet and the gaseous disk causes the migration of the planet in the disk. In this new work, we incorporate the migration of the planet and study the role of planet migration in the formation of a massive core when the population of planetesimals evolves by planet accretion, migration, and fragmentation.},

@article{Koskinen:2014,
	Abstract = {Strong ionization on close-in extrasolar giant planets (EGPs) suggests that their atmospheres may be affected by ion drag and resistive heating arising from wind-driven electrodynamics. Recent models of ion drag on these planets, however, are based on thermal ionization only and do not include the upper atmosphere above the 1 mbar level. These models are also based on simplified equations of resistive magnetohydrodynamics that are not always valid in extrasolar planet atmospheres. We show that photoionization dominates over thermal ionization over much of the dayside atmosphere above the 100 mbar level, creating an upper ionosphere dominated by ionization of H and He and a lower ionosphere dominated by ionization of metals such as Na, K, and Mg. The resulting dayside electron densities on close-in exoplanets are higher than those encountered in any planetary ionosphere of the solar system, and the conductivities are comparable to the chromosphere of the Sun. Based on these results and assumed magnetic fields, we constrain the conductivity regimes on close-in EGPs and use a generalized Ohm's law to study the basic effects of electrodynamics in their atmospheres. We find that ion drag is important above the 10 mbar level where it can also significantly alter the energy balance through resistive heating. Due to frequent collisions of the electrons and ions with the neutral atmosphere, however, ion drag is largely negligible in the lower atmosphere below the 10 mbar level for a reasonable range of planetary magnetic moments. We find that the atmospheric conductivity decreases by several orders of magnitude in the night side of tidally locked planets, leading to a potentially interesting large-scale dichotomy in electrodynamics between the day and night sides. A combined approach that relies on UV observations of the upper atmosphere, phase curve and Doppler measurements of global dynamics, and visual transit observations to probe the alkali metals can potentially be used to constrain electrodynamics in the future.},

	Abstract = {The hot Jupiter HAT-P-2b has become a prime target for Spitzer Space Telescope observations aimed at understanding the atmospheric response of exoplanets on highly eccentric orbits. Here we present a suite of three-dimensional atmospheric circulation models for HAT-P-2b that investigate the effects of assumed atmospheric composition and rotation rate on global scale winds and thermal patterns. We compare and contrast atmospheric models for HAT-P-2b, which assume one and five times solar metallicity, both with and without TiO/VO as atmospheric constituents. Additionally we compare models that assume a rotation period of half, one, and two times the nominal pseudo-synchronous rotation period. We find that changes in assumed atmospheric metallicity and rotation rate do not significantly affect model predictions of the planetary flux as a function of orbital phase. However, models in which TiO/VO are present in the atmosphere develop a transient temperature inversion between the transit and secondary eclipse events that results in significant variations in the timing and magnitude of the peak of the planetary flux compared with models in which TiO/VO are omitted from the opacity tables. We find that no one single atmospheric model can reproduce the recently observed full orbit phase curves at 3.6, 4.5 and 8.0 mum, which is likely due to a chemical process not captured by our current atmospheric models for HAT-P-2b. Further modeling and observational efforts focused on understanding the chemistry of HAT-P-2b's atmosphere are needed and could provide key insights into the interplay between radiative, dynamical, and chemical processes in a wide range of exoplanet atmospheres.},

	Abstract = {We present new calculations of Rosseland and Planck gaseous mean opacities relevant to the atmospheres of giant planets and ultracool dwarfs. Such calculations are used in modeling the atmospheres, interiors, formation, and evolution of these objects. Our calculations are an expansion of those presented in Freedman et al. to include lower pressures, finer temperature resolution, and also the higher metallicities most relevant for giant planet atmospheres. Calculations span 1 mubar to 300 bar, and 75-4000 K, in a nearly square grid. Opacities at metallicities from solar to 50 times solar abundances are calculated. We also provide an analytic fit to the Rosseland mean opacities over the grid in pressure, temperature, and metallicity. In addition to computing mean opacities at these local temperatures, we also calculate them with weighting functions up to 7000 K, to simulate the mean opacities for incident stellar intensities, rather than locally thermally emitted intensities. The chemical equilibrium calculations account for the settling of condensates in a gravitational field and are applicable to cloud-free giant planet and ultracool dwarf atmospheres, but not circumstellar disks. We provide our extensive opacity tables for public use.},

	Abstract = {We address disequilibrium abundances of some simple molecules in the atmospheres of solar composition brown dwarfs and self-luminous extrasolar giant planets using a kinetics-based one-dimensional atmospheric chemistry model. Our approach is to use the full kinetics model to survey the parameter space with effective temperatures between 500 K and 1100 K. In all of these worlds, equilibrium chemistry favors CH4 over CO in the parts of the atmosphere that can be seen from Earth, but in most disequilibrium favors CO. The small surface gravity of a planet strongly discriminates against CH4 when compared to an otherwise comparable brown dwarf. If vertical mixing is like Jupiter's, the transition from methane to CO occurs at 500 K in a planet. Sluggish vertical mixing can raise this to 600 K, but clouds or more vigorous vertical mixing could lower this to 400 K. The comparable thresholds in brown dwarfs are 1100 $\pm$ 100 K. Ammonia is also sensitive to gravity, but, unlike CH4/CO, the NH3/N2 ratio is insensitive to mixing, which makes NH3 a potential proxy for gravity. HCN may become interesting in high-gravity brown dwarfs with very strong vertical mixing. Detailed analysis of the CO-CH4 reaction network reveals that the bottleneck to CO hydrogenation goes through methanol, in partial agreement with previous work. Simple, easy to use quenching relations are derived by fitting to the complete chemistry of the full ensemble of models. These relations are valid for determining CO, CH4, NH3, HCN, and CO2 abundances in the range of self-luminous worlds we have studied, but may not apply if atmospheres are strongly heated at high altitudes by processes not considered here (e.g., wave breaking).},

	Abstract = {Context. The heating efficiency etahnu is defined as the ratio of the net local gas-heating rate to the rate of stellar radiative energy absorption. It plays an important role in thermal-escape processes from the upper atmospheres of planets that are exposed to stellar soft X-rays and extreme ultraviolet radiation (XUV).  Aims: We model the thermal-escape-related heating efficiency etahnu of the stellar XUV radiation in the hydrogen-dominated upper atmosphere of the extrasolar gas giant HD 209458b. The model result is then compared with previous thermal-hydrogen-escape studies, which assumed etahnu values between 10-100%.  Methods: The photolytic and electron impact processes in the thermosphere were studied by solving the kinetic Boltzmann equation and applying a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo model. We calculated the energy deposition rates of the stellar XUV flux and that of the accompanying primary photoelectrons that are caused by electron impact processes in the H2--> H transition region in the upper atmosphere.  Results: The heating by XUV radiation of hydrogen-dominated upper atmospheres does not reach higher values than 20% above the main thermosphere altitude, if the participation of photoelectron impact processes is included.  Conclusions: Hydrogen-escape studies from exoplanets that assume etahnu values that are >=20% probably overestimate the thermal escape or mass-loss rates, while those who assumed values that are <20% produce more realistic atmospheric-escape rates.},

	Abstract = {We present magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the atmospheres of hot Jupiters ranging in temperature from 1100 to 1800 K. Magnetic effects are negligible in atmospheres with temperatures lsim1400 K. At higher temperatures winds are variable and, in many cases, mean equatorial flows can become westward, opposite to their hydrodynamic counterparts. Ohmic dissipation peaks at temperatures ~1500-1600 K, depending on field strength, with maximum values ~1018 W at 10 bars, substantially lower than previous estimates. Based on the limited parameter study done, this value cannot be increased substantially with increasing winds, higher temperatures, higher field strengths, different boundary conditions, or lower diffusivities. Although not resolved in these simulations, there is modest evidence that a magnetic buoyancy instability may proceed in hot atmospheres.},

	Abstract = {We present a method to detect small atmospheric signals in Kepler's planet candidate light curves by averaging light curves for multiple candidates with similar orbital and physical characteristics. Our statistical method allows us to measure unbiased physical properties of Kepler's planet candidates, even for candidates whose individual signal-to-noise precludes the detection of their secondary eclipse. We detect a secondary eclipse depth of 3.83+ 1.10- 1.11 ppm for a group of 31 sub-Saturn (R < 6 R ⊕) planet candidates with the greatest potential for a reflected light signature ((Rp /a)2 > 10 ppm). Including Kepler-10b in this group increases the depth to 5.08+ 0.71- 0.72 ppm. For a control group with (Rp /a)2 < 1 ppm, we find a depth of 0.36 $\pm$ 0.37 ppm, consistent with no detection. We also analyze the light curve of Kepler-10b and find an eclipse depth of 7.08 $\pm$ 1.06 ppm. If the eclipses are due solely to reflected light, this corresponds to a geometric albedo of 0.22 $\pm$ 0.06 for our group of close-in sub-Saturns, 0.37 $\pm$ 0.05 if including Kepler-10b in the group, and 0.60 $\pm$ 0.09 for Kepler-10b alone. Including a thermal emission model does not change the geometric albedo appreciably, assuming AB = (3/2)*Ag . Our result for Kepler-10b is consistent with previous works. Our result for close-in sub-Saturns shows that Kepler-10b is unusually reflective, but our analysis is consistent with the results of Demory for super-Earths. Our results also indicate that hot Neptunes are typically more reflective than hot Jupiters.},

@article{Lambrechts:2014a,
	Abstract = {The formation of planetary cores must proceed rapidly in order for the giant planets to accrete their gaseous envelopes before the dissipation of the protoplanetary gas disc (≲3 Myr). In orbits beyond 10 AU, direct accumulation of planetesimals by the cores is too slow. Fragments of planetesimals could be accreted faster, but planetesimals are likely too large for fragmentation to be efficient, and resonant trapping poses an additional hurdle. Here we instead investigate the accretion of small pebbles (mm-cm sizes) that are the natural outcome of an equilibrium between the growth and radial drift of particles. We construct a simplified analytical model of dust coagulation and pebble drift in the outer disc, between 5 AU and 100 AU, which gives the temporal evolution of the solid surface density and the dominant particle size. These two key quantities determine how core growth proceeds at various orbital distances. We find that pebble surface densities are sufficiently high to achieve the inside-out formation of planetary cores within the disc lifetime. The overall efficiency by which dust gets converted to planets can be high, close to 50% for planetary architectures similar to the solar system. Growth by pebble accretion in the outer disc is sufficiently fast to overcome catastrophic type I migration of the cores. These results require protoplanetary discs with large radial extent (≳100 AU) and assume a low number of initial seed embryos. Our findings imply that protoplanetary discs with low disc masses, as expected around low-mass stars (<1 M&sun;), or with sub-solar dust-to-gas ratios, do not easily form gas-giant planets (M ≳ 100 ME), but preferentially form Neptune-mass planets or smaller (M ≲ 10 ME). This is consistent with exoplanet surveys which show that gas giants are relatively uncommon around stars of low mass or low metallicity.},

	Abstract = {In the solar system giant planets come in two flavours: gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn) with massive gas envelopes, and ice giants (Uranus and Neptune) with much thinner envelopes around their cores. It is poorly understood how these two classes of planets formed. High solid accretion rates, necessary to form the cores of giant planets within the life-time of protoplanetary discs, heat the envelope and prevent rapid gas contraction onto the core, unless accretion is halted. We find that, in fact, accretion of pebbles (~cm sized particles) is self-limiting: when a core becomes massive enough it carves a gap in the pebble disc. This halt in pebble accretion subsequently triggers the rapid collapse of the super-critical gas envelope. Unlike gas giants, ice giants do not reach this threshold mass and can only bind low-mass envelopes that are highly enriched by water vapour from sublimated icy pebbles. This offers an explanation for the compositional difference between gas giants and ice giants in the solar system. Furthermore, unlike planetesimal-driven accretion scenarios, our model allows core formation and envelope attraction within disc life-times, provided that solids in protoplanetary discs are predominantly made up of pebbles. Our results imply that the outer regions of planetary systems, where the mass required to halt pebble accretion is large, are dominated by ice giants and that gas-giant exoplanets in wide orbits are enriched by more than 50 Earth masses of solids.},

	Abstract = {Kepler has revolutionized the study of transiting planets with its unprecedented photometric precision on more than 150,000 target stars. Most of the transiting planet candidates detected by Kepler have been observed as long-cadence targets with 30 minute integration times, and the upcoming Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite will record full frame images with a similar integration time. Integrations of 30 minutes affect the transit shape, particularly for small planets and in cases of low signal to noise. Using the Fisher information matrix technique, we derive analytic approximations for the variances and covariances on the transit parameters obtained from fitting light curve photometry collected with a finite integration time. We find that binning the light curve can significantly increase the uncertainties and covariances on the inferred parameters when comparing scenarios with constant total signal to noise (constant total integration time in the absence of read noise). Uncertainties on the transit ingress/egress time increase by a factor of 34 for Earth-size planets and 3.4 for Jupiter-size planets around Sun-like stars for integration times of 30 minutes compared to instantaneously sampled light curves. Similarly, uncertainties on the mid-transit time for Earth and Jupiter-size planets increase by factors of 3.9 and 1.4. Uncertainties on the transit depth are largely unaffected by finite integration times. While correlations among the transit depth, ingress duration, and transit duration all increase in magnitude with longer integration times, the mid-transit time remains uncorrelated with the other parameters. We provide code in Python and Mathematica for predicting the variances and covariances at www.its.caltech.edu/~eprice.},

	Abstract = {The CoRoT satellite has provided high-precision photometric light curves for more than 163 000 stars and found several hundreds of transiting systems compatible with a planetary scenario. If ground-based velocimetric observations are the best way to identify the actual planets among many possible configurations of eclipsing binary systems, recent transit surveys have shown that it is not always within reach of the radial-velocity detection limits. In this paper, we present a transiting exoplanet candidate discovered by CoRoT whose nature cannot be established from ground-based observations, and where extensive analyses are used to validate the planet scenario. They are based on observing constraints from radial-velocity spectroscopy, adaptive optics imaging and the CoRoT transit shape, as well as from priors on stellar populations, planet and multiple stellar systems frequency. We use the fully Bayesian approach developed in the PASTIS (Planet Analysis and Small Transit Investigation Software) analysis software, and conclude that the planet scenario is at least 1400 times more probable than any other false-positive scenario. The primary star is a metallic solar-like dwarf, with Ms = 1.099 $\pm$ 0.049 M&sun; and Rs = 1.136^{+0.038}_{-0.090} R&sun;. The validated planet has a radius of Rp = 4.88^{+0.17}_{-0.39} R⊕ and mass less than 49 M⊕. Its mean density is smaller than 2.56 g cm-3 and orbital period is 9.7566 $\pm$ 0.0012 d. This object, called CoRoT-22 b, adds to a large number of validated Kepler planets. These planets do not have a proper measurement of the mass but allow statistical characterization of exoplanets population.},

@article{Hasegawa:2014a,
	Abstract = {Massive exoplanets are observed preferentially around high metallicity ([Fe/H]) stars while low-mass exoplanets do not show such an effect. This so-called planet-metallicity correlation generally favors the idea that most observed gas giants at r < 10 AU are formed via a core accretion process. We investigate the origin of this phenomenon using a semi-analytical model, wherein the standard core accretion takes place at planet traps in protostellar disks where rapid type I migrators are halted. We focus on the three major exoplanetary populations---hot Jupiters, exo-Jupiters located at r ~= 1 AU, and the low-mass planets. We show using a statistical approach that the planet-metallicity correlations are well reproduced in these models. We find that there are specific transition metallicities with values [Fe/H] = --0.2 to --0.4, below which the low-mass population dominates, and above which the Jovian populations take over. The exo-Jupiters significantly exceed the hot Jupiter population at all observed metallicities. The low-mass planets formed via the core accretion are insensitive to metallicity, which may account for a large fraction of the observed super-Earths and hot-Neptunes. Finally, a controlling factor in building massive planets is the critical mass of planetary cores (M  c, crit) that regulates the onset of rapid gas accretion. Assuming the current data is roughly complete at [Fe/H] > --0.6, our models predict that the most likely value of the "mean" critical core mass of Jovian planets is langM  c, critrang ~= 5 M ⊕ rather than 10 M ⊕. This implies that grain opacities in accreting envelopes should be reduced in order to lower M  c, crit.},

It is in the stellar low-mass regime, however, where the predictive power of stellar models is often limited by sparse data quantity with which to calibrate the methods.

	Abstract = {Planets on eccentric orbits have a higher geometric probability of transiting their host star. By application of Bayes' theorem, we reverse this logic to show that the eccentricity distribution of transiting planets is positively biased. Adopting the flexible Beta distribution as the underlying prior for eccentricity, we derive the marginalized transit probability as well as the a priori joint probability distribution of eccentricity and argument of periastron, given that a planet is known to transit. These results allow us to demonstrate that most planet occurrence rate calculations using Kepler data have overestimated the prevalence of planets by ˜10 per cent. Indeed, the true occurrence of planets from transit surveys is fundamentally intractable without a prior assumption for the eccentricity distribution. Further more, we show that previously extracted eccentricity distributions using Kepler data are positively biased. In cases where one wishes to impose an informative eccentricity prior, we provide a recursive algorithm to apply inverse transform sampling of our joint prior probability distribution. Computer code of this algorithm, <monospace>ECCSAMPLES</monospace>, is provided to enable the community to sample directly from the prior (availablehere).},

	Abstract = {Giant planets that reside in close proximity to their host stars are subject to extreme irradiation, which gives rise to thermal ionization of trace alkali metals in their atmospheres. On objects where the atmospheric electrical conductivity is substantial, the global circulation couples to the background magnetic field, inducing supplementary fields and altering the nature of the flow. To date, a number of authors have considered the influence of a spin-pole aligned dipole magnetic field on the dynamical state of a weakly ionized atmosphere and found that magnetic breaking may lead to significantly slower winds than predicted within a purely hydrodynamical framework. Here, we consider the effect of a tilted dipole magnetic field on the circulation and demonstrate that in addition to regulating wind velocities, an oblique field generates stationary non-axisymmetric structures that adhere to the geometry of the magnetic pole. Using a kinematic perturbative approach, we derive a closed-form solution for the perturbed circulation and show that the fractional distortion of zonal jets scales as the product of the field obliquity and the Els{\"a}sser number. The results obtained herein suggest that on planets with oblique magnetic fields, advective shifts of dayside hotspots may have substantial latitudinal components. This prediction may be tested observationally using the eclipse mapping technique.},

@phdthesis{Beky:2014a,
	Abstract = {Since the discovery of the first exoplanets (planets outside our Solar System) more than 20 years ago, there has been an increasing need for photometric and spectroscopic models to characterize these systems. While imaging has been used extensively for Solar System bodies and extended objects like galaxies, the small angular extent of typical planetary systems makes it difficult or impossible to resolve them. Spatially integrated observations like measuring the total brightness or spectrum, however, can be conducted at a resonable cost. This thesis focuses on photometric models in the context of transiting systems, which exhibit a number of phenomena that can be exploited for characterization.  First, we showcase the popular methods of transiting exoplanet discovery and characterization by ground based observations on the hot Jupiter HAT-P-27b. We demonstrate how transits allow us to constrain planetary mass, radius, and orbital inclination, which would not be possible based only on, for example, radial velocity measurements.  Next, we perform reflection spectroscopy on HAT-P-1b, another hot Jupiter, using the binary companion of the host star as a reference to remove systematic errors from the signal. Here the transiting nature of the system allows us to look for the very faint light reflected by the planet.  We also apply the idea of planetary transits to investigate the feasibility of transit observations in astrophysical systems of very different scale: stars in galactic nuclei potentially transiting the accretion disk of the supermassive black hole in the galactic center.  Finally, we focus on mapping spots on the stellar surface using transits. This method has been used for a decade, and helped constrain stellar rotation or orbital geometry in a number systems. We study starspots on HAT-P-11 not only to learn more about stellar rotation, but also to investigate the size and contrast of the spots themselves.},

Jupiter's magnetic field is caused by convective dynamo motion of electrically conducting fluid hydrogen. The data imply that Jupiter should become metallic at 140 gigapascals in the fluid, and the electrical conductivity in the jovian molecular envelope at pressures up to metallization is about an order of magnitude larger than expected previously. The large magnetic field is produced in the molecular envelope closer to the surface than previously thought.},

Under the assumption that these planets accrete modest hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and planetesimals, we use population synthesis models to show that predicted metal enrichments of the H/He envelope are high, with metal mass fraction Z env values commonly 0.6-0.9, or ~100-400+ times solar. The high mean molecular weight of such atmospheres (mu ≈ 5-12) would naturally help to flatten the transmission spectrum of most LMLD planets. The high metal abundance would also provide significant condensible material for cloud formation. It is known that the H/He abundance in Uranus and Neptune decreases with depth, and we show that atmospheric evaporation of LMLD planets could expose atmospheric layers with gradually higher Z env. However, values of Z env close to solar composition can also arise, so diversity should be expected. Photochemically produced hazes, potentially due to methane photolysis, are another possibility for obscuring transmission spectra. Such hazes may not form above T eq of ~800-1100 K, which is testable if such warm, otherwise low mean molecular weight atmospheres are stable against atmospheric evaporation. We find that available transmission data are consistent with relatively high mean molecular weight atmospheres for GJ 1214b and "warm Neptune" GJ 436b. We examine future prospects for characterizing GJ 1214b with Hubble and the James Webb Space Telescope.},

	Abstract = {Solar photospheric and meteoritic CI chondrite abundance determinations for all elements are summarized and the best currently available photospheric abundances are selected. The meteoritic and solar abundances of a few elements (e.g., noble gases, beryllium, boron, phosphorous, sulfur) are discussed in detail. The photospheric abundances give mass fractions of hydrogen (X=0.7491), helium (Y=0.2377), and heavy elements (Z=0.0133), leading to Z/X=0.0177, which is lower than the widely used Z/X=0.0245 from previous compilations. Recent results from standard solar models considering helium and heavy-element settling imply that photospheric abundances and mass fractions are not equal to protosolar abundances (representative of solar system abundances). Protosolar elemental and isotopic abundances are derived from photospheric abundances by considering settling effects. Derived protosolar mass fractions are X0=0.7110, Y0=0.2741, and Z0=0.0149. The solar system and photospheric abundance tables are used to compute self-consistent sets of condensation temperatures for all elements.},

	Abstract = {The solar chemical composition is an important ingredient in our understanding of the formation, structure, and evolution of both the Sun and our Solar System. Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are compared. In this review, we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a redetermination of the abundances of nearly all available elements, using a realistic new three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and accounted for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of C, N, O, and Ne compared to the widely used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values obtained in the Solar Neighborhood and from the most pristine meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has yet to find a satisfactory resolution.},

@article{Parmentier:2014c,
	Abstract = {Context. Semi-grey atmospheric models (with one opacity for the visible and one opacity for the infrared) are useful for understanding the global structure of irradiated atmospheres, their dynamics, and the interior structure and evolution of planets, brown dwarfs, and stars. When compared to direct numerical radiative transfer calculations for irradiated exoplanets, however, these models systematically overestimate the temperatures at low optical depths, independently of the opacity parameters. 
Aims: We investigate why semi-grey models fail at low optical depths and provide a more accurate approximation to the atmospheric structure by accounting for the variable opacity in the infrared. 
Methods: Using the Eddington approximation, we derive an analytical model to account for lines and/or bands in the infrared. Four parameters (instead of two for the semi-grey models) are used: a visible opacity (κv), two infrared opacities, (κ1 and κ2), and β (the fraction of the energy in the beam with opacities κ1). We consider that the atmosphere receives an incident irradiation in the visible with an effective temperature Tirr and at an angle μ∗, and that it is heated from below with an effective temperature Tint. 
Results: Our non-grey, irradiated line model is found to provide a range of temperatures that is consistent with that obtained by numerical calculations. We find that if the stellar flux is absorbed at optical depth larger than τlim = (κR/κ1κ2)(κRκP/3)1/2, it is mainly transported by the channel of lowest opacity whereas if it is absorbed at τ ≳ τlim it is mainly transported by the channel of highest opacity, independently of the spectral width of those channels. For low values of β (expected when lines are dominant), we find that the non-grey effects significantly cool the upper atmosphere. However, for β ≳ 1/2 (appropriate in the presence of bands with a wavelength-dependence smaller than or comparable to the width of the Planck function), we find that the temperature structure is affected down to infrared optical depths unity and deeper as a result of the so-called blanketing effect. 
Conclusions: The expressions that we derive can be used to provide a proper functional form for algorithms that invert the atmospheric properties from spectral information. Because a full atmospheric structure can be calculated directly, these expressions should be useful for simulations of the dynamics of these atmospheres and of the thermal evolution of the planets. Finally, they should be used to test full radiative transfer models and to improve their convergence.

	Abstract = {Context. The recent discovery and characterization of the diversity of the atmospheres of exoplanets and brown dwarfs calls for the development of fast and accurate analytical models.  Aims: We wish to assess the goodness of the different approximations used to solve the radiative transfer problem in irradiated atmospheres analytically, and we aim to provide a useful tool for a fast computation of analytical temperature profiles that remains correct over a wide range of atmospheric characteristics.  Methods: We quantify the accuracy of the analytical solution derived in paper I for an irradiated, non-grey atmosphere by comparing it to a state-of-the-art radiative transfer model. Then, using a grid of numerical models, we calibrate the different coefficients of our analytical model for irradiated solar-composition atmospheres of giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs.  Results: We show that the so-called Eddington approximation used to solve the angular dependency of the radiation field leads to relative errors of up to ~5% on the temperature profile. For grey or semi-grey atmospheres (i.e., when the visible and thermal opacities, respectively, can be considered independent of wavelength), we show that the presence of a convective zone has a limited effect on the radiative atmosphere above it and leads to modifications of the radiative temperature profile of approximately ~2%. However, for realistic non-grey planetary atmospheres, the presence of a convective zone that extends to optical depths smaller than unity can lead to changes in the radiative temperature profile on the order of 20% or more. When the convective zone is located at deeper levels (such as for strongly irradiated hot Jupiters), its effect on the radiative atmosphere is again on the same order (~2%) as in the semi-grey case. We show that the temperature inversion induced by a strong absorber in the optical, such as TiO or VO is mainly due to non-grey thermal effects reducing the ability of the upper atmosphere to cool down rather than an enhanced absorption of the stellar light as previously thought. Finally, we provide a functional form for the coefficients of our analytical model for solar-composition giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs. This leads to fully analytical pressure-temperature profiles for irradiated atmospheres with a relative accuracy better than 10% for gravities between 2.5 m s-2 and 250 m s-2 and effective temperatures between 100 K and 3000 K. This is a great improvement over the commonly used Eddington boundary condition.

	Abstract = {Context. Hot Jupiters exhibit atmospheric temperatures ranging from hundreds to thousands of Kelvin. Because of their large day-night temperature differences, condensable species that are stable in the gas phase on the dayside - such as TiO and silicates - may condense and gravitationally settle on the nightside. Atmospheric circulation may counterbalance this tendency to gravitationally settle. This three-dimensional (3D) mixing of condensable species has not previously been studied for hot Jupiters, yet it is crucial to assess the existence and distribution of TiO and silicates in the atmospheres of these planets.  Aims: We investigate the strength of the nightside cold trap in hot Jupiters atmospheres by investigating the mechanisms and strength of the vertical mixing in these stably stratified atmospheres. We apply our model to the particular case of TiO to address the question of whether TiO can exist at low pressure in sufficient abundances to produce stratospheric thermal inversions despite the nightside cold trap.  Methods: We modeled the 3D circulation of HD 209458b including passive (i.e. radiatively inactive) tracers that advect with the 3D flow, with a source and sink term on the nightside to represent their condensation into haze particles and their gravitational settling.  Results: We show that global advection patterns produce strong vertical mixing that can keep condensable species aloft as long as they are trapped in particles of sizes of a few microns or less on the nightside. We show that vertical mixing results not from small-scale convection but from the large-scale circulation driven by the day-night heating contrast. Although this vertical mixing is not diffusive in any rigorous sense, a comparison of our results with idealized diffusion models allows a rough estimate of the effective vertical eddy diffusivities in these atmospheres. The parametrization Kzz=5 × 104/ Pbar m2s-1, valid from ~1 bar to a few mubar, can be used in 1D models of HD 209458b. Moreover, our models exhibit strong spatial and temporal variability in the tracer concentration that could result in observable variations during either transit or secondary eclipse measurements. Finally, we apply our model to the case of TiO in HD 209458b and show that the day-night cold trap would deplete TiO if it condenses into particles bigger than a few microns on the planet's nightside, keeping it from creating the observed stratosphere of the planet.

@phdthesis{Parmentier:2014b,
	Abstract = {More than a thousand exoplanets have been discovered over the last decade. Perhaps more excitingly, probing their atmospheres has become possible. We now have spectra of hot Jupiters like HD 189733b and HD 209458b, of Neptune-like planets like GJ1214b and even smaller planets are within reach. Most exoplanet atmospheric observations are averaged spatially, often over a hemi- sphere (during secondary eclipse) or over the limb of the planet (during transit). For favorable targets, longitudinal and latitudinal resolution can also be obtained with phase curve and secondary eclipse mapping techniques respectively. The closer the planet orbits to its star, the easier it is to observe. These hot planets strongly differ from the examples we have in our solar-system. Proper models of their atmospheres are challenging yet necessary to understand current and future observations. In this thesis, I use a hierarchy of atmospheric models to understand the interactions between the thermal structure, the composition, the atmospheric circulation and the long-term evolution of irradiated planets. In these planets, the large stellar irradiation dominates the energy budget of the atmosphere. It powers a strong atmospheric circulation that transports heat and material around the planet, driving the atmosphere out of thermal and chemical equilibrium and affecting its long-term evolution. Future instruments (Gaia, SPIRou, CHEOPS, TESS, PLATO etc) will discover many more planets that the next generation of telescopes (GMT, TMT, E-ELT or JWST) will characterize with an unprecedented accuracy. Models will be tested on a large sample of planets, extending the study of climates to exoplanets.},

	Abstract = {Improving upon our purely dynamical work, we present three-dimensional simulations of the atmospheric circulation on Earth-like (exo)planets and hot Jupiters using the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL)-Princeton Flexible Modelling System (FMS). As the first steps away from the dynamical benchmarks of Heng, Menou & Phillipps, we add dual-band radiative transfer and dry convective adjustment schemes to our computational set-up. Our treatment of radiative transfer assumes stellar irradiation to peak at a wavelength shorter than and distinct from that at which the exoplanet re-emits radiation (`shortwave' versus `longwave'), and also uses a two-stream approximation. Convection is mimicked by adjusting unstable lapse rates to the dry adiabat. The bottom of the atmosphere is bounded by a uniform slab with a finite thermal inertia. For our models of hot Jupiter, we include an analytical formalism for calculating temperature-pressure profiles, in radiative equilibrium, which accounts for the effect of collision-induced absorption via a single parameter. We discuss our results within the context of the following: the predicted temperature-pressure profiles and the absence/presence of a temperature inversion; the possible maintenance, via atmospheric circulation, of the putative high-altitude, shortwave absorber expected to produce these inversions; the angular/temporal offset of the hotspot from the substellar point, its robustness to our ignorance of hyperviscosity and hence its utility in distinguishing between different hot Jovian atmospheres; and various zonal-mean flow quantities. Our work bridges the gap between three-dimensional simulations which are purely dynamical and those which incorporate multiband radiative transfer, thus contributing to the construction of a required hierarchy of three-dimensional theoretical models.},

	Abstract = {The equilibrium thermochemistry of the alkali elements in cool dwarf atmospheres is investigated as part of a comprehensive set of chemical equilibrium calculations. The abundances of all important gases and the condensation temperatures of all initial condensates for Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs are calculated as a function of pressure and temperature. Also discussed is the chemistry of refractory elements such as Al, Ca, Cr, Fe, Mg, Si, Ti, and V. The calculation of the alkali element and refractory element chemistry can help to constrain pressure and temperature conditions in dwarf atmospheres. A relative temperature scale is developed and compared to recent observations of the alkali elements in late-type dwarfs and brown dwarfs, such as the DENIS objects and Gliese 229B. The calculations show (1) Atomic Li gas abundances are expected to be lower than the bulk Li abundance because LiOH gas (at high total pressure) or LiCl gas (at low total pressure) form in very cool objects. Observations of only monatomic Li are therefore not a good test for the substellar nature of very cool objects. (2) The observations of atomic Cs in Gliese 229B can be understood by considering the distribution of Cs between atomic Cs and CsCl gases. (3) Liquid condensates, which may form solutions with complex compositions, form at higher pressures, and need to be considered in further atmospheric structure and opacity modeling.},

	Abstract = {Previous studies suggest that tidal interactions may be responsible for discrepancies between the ages of exoplanet host stars estimated using stellar models (isochronal ages) and age estimates based on the stars' rotation periods (gyrochronological ages). We have compiled a sample of 28 transiting exoplanet host stars with measured rotation periods. We use a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method to determine the joint posterior distribution for the mass and age of each star in the sample, and extend this method to include a calculation of the posterior distribution of the gyrochronological age. The gyrochronological age ($\tau_{\rm gyro}$) is significantly less than the isochronal age for about half of the stars in our sample. Tidal interactions between the star and planet are a reasonable explanation for this discrepancy in some cases, but not all. The distribution of $\tau_{\rm gyro}$ values is evenly spread from very young ages up to a maximum value of a few Gyr. There is no clear correlation between $\tau_{\rm gyro}$ and the strength of the tidal force on the star due to the innermost planet. There is clear evidence that the isochronal ages for some K-type stars are too large, and this may also be the case for some G-type stars. This may be the result of magnetic inhibition of convection. There is currently no satisfactory explanation for the discrepancy between the young age for CoRoT-2 estimated from either gyrochronology or its high lithium abundance, and the extremely old age for its K-type stellar companion inferred from its very low X-ray flux. There is now strong evidence that the gyrochronological ages of some transiting exoplanet host stars are significantly less than their isochronal ages, but it is not always clear that this is good evidence for tidal interactions between the star and the planet.},

	Abstract = {We present the first three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the atmosphere of HD 209458b which self-consistently include reduction of winds due to the Lorentz force and Ohmic heating. We find overall wind structures similar to that seen in previous models of hot Jupiter atmospheres, with strong equatorial jets and meridional flows poleward near the day side and equatorward near the night side. Inclusion of magnetic fields slows those winds and leads to Ohmic dissipation. We find wind slowing ranging from 10%-40% for reasonable field strengths. We find Ohmic dissipation rates ~1017 W at 100 bar, orders of magnitude too small to explain the inflated radius of this planet. Faster wind speeds, not achievable in these anelastic calculations, may be able to increase this value somewhat, but likely will not be able to close the gap necessary to explain the inflated radius. We demonstrate that the discrepancy between the simulations presented here and previous models is due to inadequate treatment of magnetic field geometry and evolution. Induced poloidal fields become much larger than those imposed, highlighting the need for a self-consistent MHD treatment of these hot atmospheres.},

@article{Spiegel:2009,
	Abstract = {Spitzer Space Telescope infrared observations indicate that several transiting extrasolar giant planets have thermal inversions in their upper atmospheres. Above a relative minimum, the temperature appears to increase with altitude. Such an inversion probably requires a species at high altitude that absorbs a significant amount of incident optical/UV radiation. Some authors have suggested that the strong optical absorbers titanium oxide (TiO) and vanadium oxide (VO) could provide the needed additional opacity, but if regions of the atmosphere are cold enough for Ti and V to be sequestered into solids they might rain out and be severely depleted. With a model of the vertical distribution of a refractory species in gaseous and condensed form, we address the question of whether enough TiO (or VO) could survive aloft in an irradiated planet's atmosphere to produce a thermal inversion. We find that it is unlikely that VO could play a critical role in producing thermal inversions. Furthermore, we find that macroscopic mixing is essential to the TiO hypothesis; without macroscopic mixing, such a heavy species cannot persist in a planet's upper atmosphere. The amount of macroscopic mixing that is required depends on the size of condensed titanium-bearing particles that form in regions of an atmosphere that are too cold for gaseous TiO to exist. We parameterize the macroscopic mixing with the eddy diffusion coefficient Kzz and find, as a function of particle size a, the values that Kzz must assume on the highly irradiated planets HD 209458b, HD 149026b, TrES-4, and OGLE-TR-56b to loft enough titanium to the upper atmosphere for the TiO hypothesis to be correct. On these planets, we find that for TiO to be responsible for thermal inversions Kzz must be at least a few times 107 cm2 s-1, even for a = 0.1 mum, and increases to nearly 1011 cm2 s-1 for a = 10 mum. Such large values may be problematic for the TiO hypothesis, but are not impossible.},

	Abstract = {Through the process of thermal ionization, intense stellar irradiation renders hot Jupiter atmospheres electrically conductive. Simultaneously, lateral variability in the irradiation drives the global circulation with peak wind speeds of the order of ~km s-1. In turn, the interactions between the atmospheric flows and the background magnetic field give rise to Lorentz forces that can act to perturb the flow away from its purely hydrodynamical counterpart. Using analytical theory and numerical simulations, we show here that significant deviations away from axisymmetric circulation are unstable in presence of a non-negligible axisymmetric magnetic field. Specifically, our results suggest that dayside-to-nightside flows, often obtained within the context of three-dimensional circulation models, only exist on objects with anomalously low magnetic fields, while the majority of highly irradiated exoplanetary atmospheres are entirely dominated by zonal jets.},

The resulting evolutionary sequences show a clear tendency toward inflated radii for effective temperatures that give rise to significant ionization of alkali metals in the atmosphere, compatible with the trend of the data. The degree of inflation shows that ohmic dissipation along with the likely variability in heavy element content can account for all of the currently detected radius anomalies. Furthermore, we find that in the absence of a massive core, low-mass hot Jupiters can overflow their Roche lobes and evaporate on Gyr timescales, possibly leaving behind small rocky cores.},

@article{Liu:2008,
	Abstract = {The atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn exhibit strong and stable zonal winds. How deep the winds penetrate unabated into each planet is unknown. Our investigation favors shallow winds. It consists of two parts. The first part makes use of an Ohmic constraint; Ohmic dissipation associated with the planet's magnetic field cannot exceed the planet's net luminosity. Application to Jupiter (J) and Saturn (S) shows that the observed zonal winds cannot penetrate below a depth at which the electrical conductivity is about six orders of magnitude smaller than its value at the molecular-metallic transition. Measured values of the electrical conductivity of molecular hydrogen yield radii of maximum penetration of 0.96R and 0.86R, with uncertainties of a few percent of R. At these radii, the magnetic Reynolds number based on the zonal wind velocity and the scale height of the magnetic diffusivity is of order unity. These limits are insensitive to difficulties in modeling turbulent convection. They permit complete penetration along cylinders of the equatorial jets observed in the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn. The second part investigates how deep the observed zonal winds actually do penetrate. As it applies heuristic models of turbulent convection, its conclusions must be regarded as tentative. Truncation of the winds in the planet's convective envelope would involve breaking the Taylor-Proudman constraint on cylindrical flow. This would require a suitable nonpotential acceleration which none of the obvious candidates appears able to provide. Accelerations arising from entropy gradients, magnetic stresses, and Reynolds stresses appear to be much too weak. These considerations suggest that strong zonal winds are confined to shallow, stably stratified layers, with equatorial jets being the possible exception.},

	Abstract = {The post-formation, initial entropy Si of a gas giant planet is a key witness to its mass-assembly history and a crucial quantity for its early evolution. However, formation models are not yet able to predict reliably Si, making unjustified the use solely of traditional, `hot-start' cooling tracks to interpret direct-imaging results and calling for an observational determination of initial entropies to guide formation scenarios. Using a grid of models in mass and entropy, we show how to place joint constraints on the mass and initial entropy of an object from its observed luminosity and age. This generalizes the usual estimate of only a lower bound on the real mass, through hot-start tracks. Moreover, we demonstrate that with mass information, e.g. from dynamical-stability analyses or radial velocity, tighter bounds can be set on the initial entropy. We apply this procedure to 2M1207 b and find that its initial entropy is at least 9.2 kB/baryon, assuming that it does not burn deuterium. For the planets of the HR 8799 system, we infer that they must have formed with Si > 9.2 kB/baryon, independent of uncertainties about the age of the star. Finally, a similar analysis for beta Pic b reveals that it must have formed with Si > 10.5 kB/baryon, using the radial-velocity mass upper limit. These initial entropy values are, respectively, ca. 0.7, 0.5 and 1.5 kB/baryon higher than the ones obtained from core-accretion models by Marley et al., thereby quantitatively ruling out the coldest starts for these objects and constraining warm starts, especially for beta Pic b.},

	Abstract = {We present a new version of our code for modeling the atmospheric circulation on gaseous exoplanets, now employing a "double-gray" radiative transfer scheme, which self-consistently solves for fluxes and heating throughout the atmosphere, including the emerging (observable) infrared flux. We separate the radiation into infrared and optical components, each with its own absorption coefficient, and solve standard two-stream radiative transfer equations. We use a constant optical absorption coefficient, while the infrared coefficient can scale as a power law with pressure; however, for simplicity, the results shown in this paper use a constant infrared coefficient. Here we describe our new code in detail and demonstrate its utility by presenting a generic hot Jupiter model. We discuss issues related to modeling the deepest pressures of the atmosphere and describe our use of the diffusion approximation for radiative fluxes at high optical depths. In addition, we present new models using a simple form for magnetic drag on the atmosphere. We calculate emitted thermal phase curves and find that our drag-free model has the brightest region of the atmosphere offset by ~12$\,^{\circ}$ from the substellar point and a minimum flux that is 17% of the maximum, while the model with the strongest magnetic drag has an offset of only ~2$\,^{\circ}$ and a ratio of 13%. Finally, we calculate rates of numerical loss of kinetic energy at ~15% for every model except for our strong-drag model, where there is no measurable loss; we speculate that this is due to the much decreased wind speeds in that model.},

	Abstract = {Hot Jupiters, with atmospheric temperatures T >~ 1000 K, have residual thermal ionization levels sufficient for the interaction of ions with the planetary magnetic field to result in a sizable magnetic drag on the (neutral) atmospheric winds. We evaluate the magnitude of magnetic drag in a representative three-dimensional atmospheric model of the hot Jupiter HD 209458b and find that it is a plausible mechanism to limit wind speeds in this class of atmospheres. Magnetic drag has a strong geometrical dependence, both meridionally and from the dayside to the nightside (in the upper atmosphere), which could have interesting consequences for the atmospheric flow pattern. By extension, close-in eccentric planets with transiently heated atmospheres will experience time-variable levels of magnetic drag. A robust treatment of magnetic drag in circulation models for hot atmospheres may require iterated solutions to the magnetic induction and Saha equations as the hydrodynamic flow is evolved.},

	Abstract = {Hot Jupiter atmospheres exhibit fast, weakly ionized winds. The interaction of these winds with the planetary magnetic field generates drag on the winds and leads to ohmic dissipation of the induced electric currents. We study the magnitude of ohmic dissipation in representative, three-dimensional atmospheric circulation models of the hot Jupiter HD 209458b. We find that ohmic dissipation can reach or exceed 1% of the stellar insolation power in the deepest atmospheric layers, in models with and without dragged winds. Such power, dissipated in the deep atmosphere, appears sufficient to slow down planetary contraction and explain the typically inflated radii of hot Jupiters. This atmospheric scenario does not require a top insulating layer or radial currents that penetrate deep in the planetary interior. Circulation in the deepest atmospheric layers may actually be driven by spatially non-uniform ohmic dissipation. A consistent treatment of magnetic drag and ohmic dissipation is required to further elucidate the consequences of magnetic effects for the atmospheres and the contracting interiors of hot Jupiters.},

@article{Menou:2012b,
	Abstract = {We present scaling laws for advection, radiation, magnetic drag, and ohmic dissipation in the atmospheres of hot giant exoplanets. In the limit of weak thermal ionization, ohmic dissipation increases with the planetary equilibrium temperature (T eq >~ 1000 K) faster than the insolation power does, eventually reaching values >~ 1% of the insolation power, which may be sufficient to inflate the radii of hot Jupiters. At higher T eq values still magnetic drag rapidly brakes the atmospheric winds, which reduces the associated ohmic dissipation power. For example, for a planetary field strength B = 10 G, the fiducial scaling laws indicate that ohmic dissipation exceeds 1% of the insolation power over the equilibrium temperature range T eq ~ 1300-2000 K, with a peak contribution at T eq ~ 1600 K. Evidence for magnetically dragged winds at the planetary thermal photosphere could emerge in the form of reduced longitudinal offsets for the dayside infrared hotspot. This suggests the possibility of an anticorrelation between the amount of hotspot offset and the degree of radius inflation, linking the atmospheric and interior properties of hot giant exoplanets in an observationally testable way. While providing a useful framework to explore the magnetic scenario, the scaling laws also reveal strong parameter dependencies, in particular with respect to the unknown planetary magnetic field strength.},

	Abstract = {Using a full frequency-dependent atmosphere code that can incorporate irradiation by a central primary star, we calculate self-consistent boundary conditions for the evolution of the radius of the transiting planet HD 209458b. Using a well-tested extrasolar giant planet evolutionary code, we then calculate the behavior of this planet's radius with age. The measured radius is in fact a transit radius that resides high in HD 209458b's inflated atmosphere. Using our derived atmospheric and interior structures, we find that irradiation plus the proper interpretation of the transit radius can yield a theoretical radius that is within the measured error bars. We conclude that if HD 209458b's true transit radius is at the lower end of the measured range, an extra source of core heating power is not necessary to explain the transit observations.},

	Abstract = {We study the radius evolution of close-in extra-solar Jupiters under Ohmic heating, a mechanism that was recently proposed to explain the large observed sizes of many of these planets. Planets are born with high entropy and they subsequently cool and contract. We focus on two cases: first, that Ohmic heating commences when the planet is hot (high entropy); and second, that it commences after the planet has cooled. In the former case, we use analytical scaling and numerical experiments to confirm that Ohmic heating is capable of suspending the cooling as long as a few percent of the stellar irradiation is converted into Ohmic heating and the planet has a surface wind that extends to pressures of ~10 bar or deeper. For these parameters, the radii at which cooling is stalled are consistent with (or larger than) the observed radii of most planets. The only two exceptions are WASP-17b and HAT-P-32b. In contrast to the high entropy case, we show that Ohmic heating cannot significantly re-inflate planets after they have already cooled. This leads us to suggest that the diversity of radii observed in hot Jupiters may be partially explained by the different epochs at which they are migrated to their current locations.},

	Abstract = {We present models of ohmic heating in the interiors of hot Jupiters in which we decouple the interior and the wind zone by replacing the wind zone with a boundary temperature T iso and magnetic field B phi0. Ohmic heating influences the contraction of gas giants in two ways: by direct heating within the convection zone and by heating outside the convection zone, which increases the effective insulation of the interior. We calculate these effects and show that internal ohmic heating is only able to slow the contraction rate of a cooling gas giant once the planet reaches a critical value of internal entropy. We determine the age of the gas giant when ohmic heating becomes important as a function of mass, T iso, and induced B phi0. With this survey of parameter space complete, we then adopt the wind zone scalings of Menou and calculate the expected evolution of gas giants with different levels of irradiation. We find that, with this prescription of magnetic drag, it is difficult to inflate massive planets or those with strong irradiation using ohmic heating, meaning that we are unable to account for many of the observed hot Jupiter radii. This is in contrast to previous evolutionary models that assumed that a constant fraction of the irradiation is transformed into ohmic power.},

	Abstract = {The hot Neptune orbiting around GJ 436 is a unique example of an intermediate mass planet. Its close-in orbit suggests that the planet has undergone migration and its study is fundamental to understand planet formation and evolution. As it transits its parent star, it is the only Neptune-mass extrasolar planet of known mass and radius, being slightly larger and more massive than Neptune (M=22.6~M_⊕, R=4.19~R_⊕). In this regime, several bulk compositions are possible: from an Earth-like core with a thick hydrogen envelope to a water-rich planet with a thin hydrogen envelope, and comprising a Neptune-like structure. We combine planet-structure modelling with an advanced planet-formation model to assess the likelihood of the different possible bulk compositions of GJ 436 b. We find that both an envelope-free water planet (``Ocean planet'') as well as a diminute version of a gaseous giant planet are excluded. Consisting of a rocky core with a thick hydrogen/helium envelope, a ``dry'' composition produces not only too small a radius but is also a very unlikely outcome of planet formation around such a low-mass star. We conclude that GJ 436 b is probably of much higher rock content than Neptune (more than 45% in mass), with a small H-He envelope (10-20% in mass). This is the expected outcome of the gathering of materials during the migration process in the inner disk, creating a population of which the hot Neptune is representative.},

	Abstract = {Determination of an exoplanet's mass is a key to understanding its basic properties, including its potential for supporting life. To date, mass constraints for exoplanets are predominantly based on radial velocity (RV) measurements, which are not suited for planets with low masses, large semimajor axes, or those orbiting faint or active stars. Here, we present a method to extract an exoplanet's mass solely from its transmission spectrum. We find good agreement between the mass retrieved for the hot Jupiter HD 189733b from transmission spectroscopy with that from RV measurements. Our method will be able to retrieve the masses of Earth-sized and super-Earth planets using data from future space telescopes that were initially designed for atmospheric characterization.},

	Abstract = {We present a novel method for estimating lower-limit surface gravities (log g) of Kepler targets whose data do not allow the detection of solar-like oscillations. The method is tested using an ensemble of solar-type stars observed in the context of the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium. We then proceed to estimate lower-limit log g for a cohort of Kepler solar-type planet-candidate host stars with no detected oscillations. Limits on fundamental stellar properties, as provided by this work, are likely to be useful in the characterization of the corresponding candidate planetary systems. Furthermore, an important byproduct of the current work is the confirmation that amplitudes of solar-like oscillations are suppressed in stars with increased levels of surface magnetic activity.},

	Abstract = {Royal Society Discussion Meeting (2013) `Characterizing exoplanets'. Of the 900+ confirmed exoplanets discovered since 1995 for which we have constraints on their mass (i.e., not including Kepler candidates), 75% have masses larger than Saturn (0.3MJ), 53% are more massive than Jupiter, and 67% are within 1 AU of their host stars. And yet the term `hot Jupiter' fails to account for the incredible diversity of this class of object, which exists on a continuum of giant planets from the cool jovians of our own solar system to the highly-irradiated, tidally-locked hot roasters. We review theoretical expectations for the temperatures, molecular composition and cloud properties of Jupiter-class objects under a variety of different conditions. We discuss the classification schemes for these Jupiter-class planets proposed to date, including the implications for our own Solar System giant planets and the pitfalls associated with classification at this early stage of exoplanetary spectroscopy. We discuss the range of planetary types described by previous authors, accounting for: (i) thermochemical equilibrium expectations for cloud condensation and favoured chemical stability fields; (ii) the metallicity and formation mechanism for these giant planets; (iii) the importance of optical absorbers for energy partitioning and the generation of a temperature inversion; (iv) the favoured photochemical pathways and expectations for minor species (e.g., saturated hydrocarbons and nitriles); (v) the unexpected presence of molecules due to vertical mixing of species above their quench levels; and (vi) methods for energy and material redistribution throughout the atmosphere (e.g., away from the highly irradiated daysides of close-in giants). Finally, we will discuss the benefits and flaws of retrieval techniques for establishing a family of atmospheric solutions that reproduce the available data.},

	Abstract = {Variability in the time series brightness of a star on a timescale of 8 hr, known as "flicker," has been previously demonstrated to serve as a proxy for the surface gravity of a star by Bastien et al. Although surface gravity is crucial for stellar classification, it is the mean stellar density that is most useful when studying transiting exoplanets, due to its direct impact on the transit light curve shape. Indeed, an accurate and independent measure of the stellar density can be leveraged to infer subtle properties of a transiting system, such as the companion's orbital eccentricity via asterodensity profiling (AP). We here calibrate flicker to the mean stellar density of 439 Kepler targets with asteroseismology, allowing us to derive a new empirical relation given by log10(rhosstarf (kg m-3)) = 5.413 - 1.850log10(F 8 (ppm)). The calibration is valid for stars with 4500 < T eff < 6500 K, KP < 14, and flicker estimates corresponding to stars with 3.25 < log g sstarf < 4.43. Our relation has a model error in the stellar density of 31.7% and so has ~8 times lower precision than that from asteroseismology but is applicable to a sample ~40 times greater. Flicker therefore provides an empirical method to enable AP on hundreds of planetary candidates from present and future missions.},

	Abstract = {The relative abundances of carbon and oxygen have long been recognized as fundamental diagnostics of stellar chemical evolution. Now, the growing number of exoplanet observations enable estimation of these elements in exoplanetary atmospheres. In hot Jupiters, the C/O ratio affects the partitioning of carbon in the major observable molecules, making these elements diagnostic of temperature structure and composition. Here we present measurements of carbon and oxygen abundances in 16 stars that host transiting hot Jupiter exoplanets, and we compare our C/O ratios to those measured in larger samples of host stars, as well as those estimated for the corresponding exoplanet atmospheres. With standard stellar abundance analysis we derive stellar parameters as well as [C/H] and [O/H] from multiple abundance indicators, including synthesis fitting of the [O I] lambda6300 line and non-LTE corrections for the O I triplet. Our results, in agreement with recent suggestions, indicate that previously measured exoplanet host star C/O ratios may have been overestimated. The mean transiting exoplanet host star C/O ratio from this sample is 0.54 (C/O&sun; = 0.54), versus previously measured C/Ohost star means of ~0.65-0.75. We also observe the increase in C/O with [Fe/H] expected for all stars based on Galactic chemical evolution; a linear fit to our results falls slightly below that of other exoplanet host star studies but has a similar slope. Though the C/O ratios of even the most-observed exoplanets are still uncertain, the more precise abundance analysis possible right now for their host stars can help constrain these planets' formation environments and current compositions.  Based on data collected at Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.  Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

	Abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of phase curves and secondary eclipses in the Kepler data set using all available data from 15 quarters. Our original sample consists of 489 Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI) with R_p > 4 R_e , P < 10d, V_mag < 15 from the latest data release. Here we focus on 20 confirmed planets from that sample and derive their temperatures and albedos. Our results confirm and in most cases improve parameters derived by previous studies. We present new results for Kepler 1b-8b, 12b-15b, 17b, 40b, 41b, 43b, 44b, 76b, 77b, and 412b derived in a consistent manner. Furthermore we present a lightcurve analysis of Kepler 91b and Kepler 74b. Both show extra dimmings at times other than of the expected primary and secondary eclipses. Corrected for thermal emission we find the 20 planets we analyzed separate into two groups of high (>0.1) and low (<0.1) albedos, with no significant correlation to any stellar or planetary parameters. However the most massive planets from our sample are all low in albedo.},

@article{Zhang:2014,
	Abstract = {Exoplanet searches have discovered a large number of "hot Jupiters"---high-mass planets orbiting very close to their parent stars in nearly circular orbits. A number of these planets are sufficiently massive and close-in to be significantly affected by tidal dissipation in the parent star, to a degree parameterized by the tidal quality factor Q *. This process speeds up their star's rotation rate while reducing the planet's semimajor axis. In this paper, we investigate the tidal destruction of hot Jupiters. Because the orbital angular momenta of these planets are a significant fraction of their star's rotational angular momenta, they spin up their stars significantly while spiraling to their deaths. Using the Monte Carlo simulation, we predict that for Q * = 106, 3.9 × 10-6 of stars with the Kepler Target Catalog's mass distribution should have a rotation period shorter than 1/3 day (8 hr) due to accreting a planet. Exoplanet surveys such as SuperWASP, HATnet, HATsouth, and KELT have already produced light curves of millions of stars. These two facts suggest that it may be possible to search for tidally destroyed planets by looking for stars with extremely short rotational periods, then looking for remnant planet cores around those candidates, anomalies in the metal distribution, or other signatures of the recent accretion of the planet.},

@article{Hasegawa:2014,
	Abstract = {The ubiquity of planets poses an interesting question: when are first planets formed in galaxies? We investigate this by adopting a theoretical model where planet traps are combined with the standard core accretion scenario in which the efficiency of forming planetary cores directly relates to the metallicity ([Fe/H]) in disks. Three characteristic exoplanetary populations are examined: hot Jupiters, exo-Jupiters around 1 AU, and low-mass planets in tight orbits, such as super-Earths. We statistically compute planet formation frequencies (PFFs), as well as the orbital radius (\mathinner {\langle {R_{rapid}}\rangle }) within which gas accretion becomes efficient enough to form Jovian planets, as a function of metallicity (-2 <= [Fe/H] <=-0.6). We show that the total PFFs for these three populations increase steadily with metallicity. This is the direct outcome of the core accretion picture. For the metallicity range considered here, the population of low-mass planets dominates Jovian planets. The Jovian planets contribute to the PFFs above [Fe/H] ~= -1. We find that the hot Jupiters form more efficiently than the exo-Jupiters at [Fe/H] <~ -0.7. This arises from the slower growth of planetary cores and their more efficient radial inward transport by the host traps in lower metallicity disks. We show that the critical metallicity for forming Jovian planets is [Fe/H] ~= -1.2 by comparing \mathinner {\langle {R_{rapid}}\rangle } of hot Jupiters and low-mass planets. The comparison intrinsically links to the different gas accretion efficiency between these two types of planets. Therefore, this study implies that important physical processes in planet formation may be tested by exoplanet observations around metal-poor stars.},

	Abstract = {We make publicly available an efficient, versatile, easy-to-use-and-extend tool for calculating the evolution of circular-aligned planetary orbits due to the tidal dissipation in the host star. This mode fully accounts for the evolution of the angular momentum of the stellar convective envelope by the tidal coupling, the transfer of angular momentum between the stellar convective and radiative zones, the effects of the stellar evolution on the tidal dissipation efficiency and stellar core and envelope spins, the loss of stellar convective zone angular momentum to a magnetically launched wind, and frequency-dependent tidal dissipation. This is only a first release and further development is under way to allow calculating the evolution of inclined and eccentric orbits, with the latter including the tidal dissipation in the planet and its feedback on planetary structure. Considerable effort has been devoted to providing extensive documentation detailing both the usage and the complete implementation details, in order to make it as easy as possible for independent groups to use and/or extend the code for their purposes. POET represents a significant improvement over some previous models for planetary tidal evolution and so has many astrophysical applications. In this article, we describe and illustrate several key examples.},

@article{Mordasini:2014,
	Abstract = {Context. We investigate the grain opacity k_gr in the atmosphere of protoplanets. This is important for the planetary mass-radius relation since k_gr affects the H/He envelope mass of low-mass planets and the critical core mass of giant planets. Aims. The goal of this study is to derive an analytical model for k_gr. Methods. Our model is based on the comparison of the timescales of microphysical processes like grain settling in the Stokes and Epstein regime, growth by Brownian motion coagulation and differential settling, grain evaporation, and grain advection due to envelope contraction. With these timescales we derive the grain size, abundance, and opacity. Results. We find that the main growth process is differential settling. In this regime, k_gr has a simple functional form and is given as 27 Q/8 H rho in the Epstein regime and as 2 Q/H rho for Stokes drag. Grain dynamics lead to a typical radial structure of k_gr with high ISM-like values in the top layers but a strong decrease in the deeper parts where the grain-free molecular opacities take over. Conclusions. In agreement with earlier results we find that k_gr is typically much lower than in the ISM. The equations also show that a higher dust input in the top layer does not strongly increase k_gr with two important implications. First, for a formation of giant planet cores via pebbles, there could be the issue that pebbles increase the grain input high in the atmosphere due to ablation. This could potentially increase k_gr hindering giant planet formation. Our study shows that this adverse effect should not occur. Second, it means that a higher stellar [Fe/H] which presumably leads to a higher surface density of planetesimals only favors giant planet formation without being detrimental to it due to an increased k_gr. This corroborates the result that core accretion explains the increase of the giant planet frequency with [Fe/H].},

	Abstract = {In the context of CoRoT, Kepler, Gaia, TESS, and PLATO, precise and accurate stellar ages, masses and radii are of paramount importance. They are crucial to constrain scenarii of planetary formation and evolution.We aim at quantifying how detailed stellar modeling improves the accuracy and precision on age and mass of individual stars. We adopt a multifaceted approach where we examine how the number of observational constraints as well as the uncertainties on observations and on model input physics impact the age-dating and weighing. We modelled the exoplanet host-star HD52265, a MS, solar-like oscillator observed by CoRoT. We considered different sets of observational constraints (HR data, metallicity, seismic constraints). For each case, we determined the age, mass, and properties of HD52265 inferred from models, and quantified the impact of the models inputs. Our seismic analysis provides an age A=2.10-2.54 Gyr, a mass M=1.14-1.32 Msun, and a radius R=1.30-1.34 Rsun, which corresponds to uncertainties of 10, 7, and 3% respectively. Our seismic study provides constraints on surface convection, through the mixing-length found to be 12-15% smaller than the solar one. Because of helium-mass degeneracy, the initial He abundance is determined modulo the mass. The seismic mass of the exoplanet is found to be Mp sin i=1.17-1.26 MJup, much more precise than what can be derived by HR diagram inversion. We demonstrate that asteroseismology allows to improve the age accuracy compared to other methods. We emphasize that the knowledge of the mean properties of oscillations -as the large frequency separation- is not enough for deriving accurate ages. We need precise individual frequencies to narrow the age scatter due to model uncertainties. This strengthen the case for precise classical stellar parameters and frequencies as will be obtained by Gaia and PLATO.},

	Abstract = {Using a sample of 68 planet-hosting stars I carry out a comparison of isochrone fitting and gyrochronology to investigate whether tidal interactions between the stars and their planets are leading to underestimated ages using the latter method. I find a slight tendency for isochrones to produce older age estimates but find no correlation with tidal time-scale, although for some individual systems the effect of tides might be leading to more rapid rotation than expected from the stars' isochronal age, and therefore an underestimated gyrochronology age. By comparing to planetary systems in stellar clusters, I also find that in some cases isochrone fitting can overestimate the age of the star. The evidence for any bias on a sample-wide level is inconclusive. 
I also consider the subset of my sample for which the sky-projected alignment angle between the stellar rotation axis and the planet's orbital axis has been measured, finding similar patterns to those identified in the full sample. However, small sample sizes for both the misaligned and aligned systems prevent strong conclusions from being drawn.},

	Abstract = {We analyzed the Kepler light curves of four transiting hot-Jupiter systems- KOI-13, HAT-P-7, TrES-2 and Kepler-76, which show BEaming, Ellipsoidal and Reflection (BEER) phase modulations. The mass of the four planets can be estimated from either the beaming or the ellipsoidal amplitude, given the mass and radii of their parent stars. For all four systems, we find that the beaming-based planetary-mass estimate is larger than the mass estimated from the ellipsoidal amplitude, consistent with previous studies for three of these systems- KOI-13, TrES-2 and Kepler-76. We suggest the apparent discrepancy is due to superrotation, first observed for HD 189733b in the infrared. Superrotation of a tidally-locked hot-Jupiter involves an eastward displacement of the planet hot spot from the substellar point, probably due to winds in the planetary atmosphere, an effect that induces an angle shift of the planet reflection/emission phase modulation. In our analysis this angle shift "leaks" into the beaming modulation, artificially increasing its amplitude. Therefore, the mass derived from the beaming amplitude is larger than the real one. We propose a modified BEER model that includes superrotation and provides a photometry-consistent estimate of the planetary mass. Our analysis shows that the new superrotation BEER model fits the data better than a zero phase-shift null model for KOI-13, HAT-P-7, TrES-2 and Kepler-76. The new model mass estimates are in excellent agreement with the planetary masses derived from radial-velocity measurements, available for HAT-P-7, TrES-2 and Kepler-76. This makes the superrotation BEER model a viable tool for estimating the masses of hot-Jupiters from the photometric BEER modulations alone. We conclude that hot-Jupiter superrotation may be a common phenomena that can be detected in the Kepler light curves of planets that show significant BEER phase modulations.},

@article{Esteves:2014,
	Abstract = {We present a comprehensive analysis of planetary phase variations, including possible planetary light offsets, using eighteen quarters of data from the Kepler space telescope. After correcting for systematics, we found fourteen systems with significant detections in each of the phase curve components: planet's phase function, secondary eclipse, Doppler boosting and ellipsoidal variations. We model the full phase curve simultaneously, including primary and secondary transits, and derive albedos, day- and night-side temperatures and planet masses. We find that KOI-13b, with a small eccentricity, is the only planet for which an eccentric orbit is favored. We detect a third harmonic with an amplitude of 1.9 ppm for HAT-P-7b for the first time, and confirm the third harmonic for KOI-13b reported in Esteves et al. (2013): both could be due to their spin-orbit misalignments. We also performed a bootstrap analysis of each of our targets, and conclude that the photometric variations of Kepler-43b are not of planetary origin but instead a result of stellar variability and/or residual systematics. For seven planets, we find that the planetary light peak is offset from the substellar point: of those, the hottest two exhibit shifts eastward or to the evening-side, while the cooler five peak westward or on the morning-side. Our findings dramatically increase the number of Kepler planets with detected planetary light offsets, and provide the first evidence in the Kepler data for a correlation between the peak offset direction and the planet's temperature. Such a correlation could arise if thermal emission dominates light from hotter planets that harbor hot spots shifted to the east, as theoretically predicted, while reflected light dominates cooler planets with clouds westward of the substellar point (i.e. on the morning-side).},

	Abstract = {The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Kepler space mission observed a large number of planetary transits showing anomalies due to starspot eclipses, with more such observations expected in the near future by the K2 mission and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). To facilitate analysis of this phenomenon, we present spotrod, a model for planetary transits of stars with an arbitrary limb darkening law and a number of homogeneous, circular spots on their surface. A free, open source implementation written in C, ready to use in Python, is available for download. We analyze Kepler observations of the planetary host star HAT-P-11, and study the size and contrast of more than two hundred starspots. We find that the flux ratio of spots ranges at least from 0.6 to 0.9, corresponding to an effective temperature approximately 100 to 450 K lower than the stellar surface, although it is possible that some spots are darker than 0.5. The largest detected spots have a radius less than approximately 0.2 stellar radii.},

	Abstract = {Knowledge of Jupiter's deep interior would provide unique constraints on the formation of the Solar System. Measurement of its core mass and global composition would shed light on whether the planet formed by accretion or by direct gravitational collapse. At present, the inner structure of Jupiter is poorly constrained and seismology, which consists of identifying acoustic eigenmodes, offers a way to directly measure its deep sound speed profile, and thus its physical properties. Seismology of Jupiter has been considered since the mid 1970s, but hitherto the various attempts to detect global modes have led, at best, to ambiguous results. We report the detection of global modes of Jupiter, based on radial velocity measurements performed with the SYMPA Fourier spectro-imager. The global seismic parameters that we measure include the frequency of maximum amplitude 1213 $\pm$ 50 muHz, the mean large frequency spacing between radial harmonics 155.3 $\pm$ 2.2 muHz, and the mode maximum amplitude 49-10+8 cm s-1, all values that are consistent with current models of Jupiter. This result opens the way to the investigation of the inner structure of the Solar System's giant planets based on seismology techniques.},

	Abstract = {GJ 1214b stands out among the detected low-mass exoplanets, because it is, so far, the only one amenable to transmission spectroscopy. Up to date there is no consensus about the composition of its envelope although most studies suggest a high molecular weight atmosphere. In particular, it is unclear if hydrogen and helium are present or if the atmosphere is water dominated. Here, we present results on the composition of the envelope obtained by using an internal structure and evolutionary model to fit the mass and radius data. By examining all possible mixtures of water and H/He, with the corresponding opacities, we find that the bulk amount of H/He of GJ 1214b is at most 7% by mass. In general, we find the radius of warm sub-Neptunes to be most sensitive to the amount of H/He. We note that all (Kepler-11b,c,d,f, Kepler-18b, Kepler-20b, 55Cnc-e, Kepler-36c, and Kepler-68b) but two (Kepler-11e and Kepler-30b) of the discovered low-mass planets so far have less than 10% H/He. In fact, Kepler-11e and Kepler-30b have 10%-18% and 5%-15% bulk H/He. Conversely, little can be determined about the H2O or rocky content of sub-Neptune planets. We find that although a 100% water composition fits the data for GJ 1214b, based on formation constraints the presence of heavier refractory material on this planet is expected, and hence, so is a component lighter than water required. The same is true for Kepler-11f. A robust determination by transmission spectroscopy of the composition of the upper atmosphere of GJ 1214b will help determine the extent of compositional segregation between the atmosphere and the envelope.},

@article{Helled:2013,
	Abstract = {The accurate determination of Saturn's gravitational coefficients by Cassini could provide tighter constraints on Saturn's internal structure. Also, occultation measurements provide important information on the planetary shape which is often not considered in structure models. In this paper we explore how wind velocities and internal rotation affect the planetary shape and the constraints on Saturn's interior. We show that within the geodetic approach the derived physical shape is insensitive to the assumed deep rotation. Saturn's re-derived equatorial and polar radii at 100 mbar are found to be 54,445 $\pm$ 10 km and 60,365 $\pm$ 10 km, respectively. To determine Saturn's interior, we use one-dimensional three-layer hydrostatic structure models and present two approaches to include the constraints on the shape. These approaches, however, result in only small differences in Saturn's derived composition. The uncertainty in Saturn's rotation period is more significant: with Voyager's 10h39m period, the derived mass of heavy elements in the envelope is 0-7 M ⊕. With a rotation period of 10h32m, this value becomes <4 M ⊕, below the minimum mass inferred from spectroscopic measurements. Saturn's core mass is found to depend strongly on the pressure at which helium phase separation occurs, and is estimated to be 5-20 M ⊕. Lower core masses are possible if the separation occurs deeper than 4 Mbar. We suggest that the analysis of Cassini's radio occultation measurements is crucial to test shape models and could lead to constraints on Saturn's rotation profile and departures from hydrostatic equilibrium.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we investigate the formation of Uranus and Neptune, according to the core-nucleated accretion model, considering formation locations ranging from 12 to 30 AU from the Sun, and with various disk solid-surface densities and core accretion rates. It is shown that in order to form Uranus-like and Neptune-like planets in terms of final mass and solid-to-gas ratio, very specific conditions are required. We also show that when recently proposed high solid accretion rates are assumed, along with solid surface densities about 10 times those in the minimum-mass solar nebula, the challenge in forming Uranus and Neptune at large radial distances is no longer the formation timescale, but is rather finding agreement with the final mass and composition of these planets. In fact, these conditions are more likely to lead to gas-giant planets. Scattering of planetesimals by the forming planetary core is found to be an important effect at the larger distances. Our study emphasizes how (even slightly) different conditions in the protoplanetary disk and the birth environment of the planetary embryos can lead to the formation of very different planets in terms of final masses and compositions (solid-to-gas ratios), which naturally explains the large diversity of intermediate-mass exoplanets.},

	Abstract = {In this Letter, we present an overview of the rich population of systems with multiple candidate transiting planets found in the first four months of Kepler data. The census of multiples includes 115 targets that show two candidate planets, 45 with three, eight with four, and one each with five and six, for a total of 170 systems with 408 candidates. When compared to the 827 systems with only one candidate, the multiples account for 17% of the total number of systems, and one-third of all the planet candidates. We compare the characteristics of candidates found in multiples with those found in singles. False positives due to eclipsing binaries are much less common for the multiples, as expected. Singles and multiples are both dominated by planets smaller than Neptune; 69+2  - 3% for singles and 86+2  - 5% for multiples. This result, that systems with multiple transiting planets are less likely to include a transiting giant planet, suggests that close-in giant planets tend to disrupt the orbital inclinations of small planets in flat systems, or maybe even prevent the formation of such systems in the first place.},

	Abstract = {We extend the statistical analysis performed by Lissauer et al. in 2012, which demonstrates that the overwhelming majority of Kepler candidate multiple transiting systems (multis) represents true transiting planets, and we develop therefrom a procedure to validate large numbers of planet candidates in multis as bona fide exoplanets. We show that this statistical framework correctly estimates the abundance of false positives already identified around Kepler targets with multiple sets of transit-like signatures based on their abundance around targets with single sets of transit-like signatures. We estimate the number of multis that represent split systems of one or more planets orbiting each component of a binary star system. We use the high reliability rate for multis to validate more than one dozen particularly interesting multi-planet systems herein. Hundreds of additional multi-planet systems are validated in a companion paper by Rowe et al. We note that few very short period (P < 1.6 days) planets orbit within multiple transiting planet systems and discuss possible reasons for their absence. There also appears to be a shortage of planets with periods exceeding a few months in multis.},

@article{Lissauer:2012,
	Abstract = {We present a statistical analysis that demonstrates that the overwhelming majority of Kepler candidate multiple transiting systems (multis) indeed represent true, physically associated transiting planets. Binary stars provide the primary source of false positives among Kepler planet candidates, implying that false positives should be nearly randomly distributed among Kepler targets. In contrast, true transiting planets would appear clustered around a smaller number of Kepler targets if detectable planets tend to come in systems and/or if the orbital planes of planets encircling the same star are correlated. There are more than one hundred times as many Kepler planet candidates in multi-candidate systems as would be predicted from a random distribution of candidates, implying that the vast majority are true planets. Most of these multis are multiple-planet systems orbiting the Kepler target star, but there are likely cases where (1) the planetary system orbits a fainter star, and the planets are thus significantly larger than has been estimated, or (2) the planets orbit different stars within a binary/multiple star system. We use the low overall false-positive rate among Kepler multis, together with analysis of Kepler spacecraft and ground-based data, to validate the closely packed Kepler-33 planetary system, which orbits a star that has evolved somewhat off of the main sequence. Kepler-33 hosts five transiting planets, with periods ranging from 5.67 to 41 days.},

	Abstract = {Eclipsing systems, such as transiting exoplanets, allow one to measure the mean stellar density of the host star under various idealized assumptions. Asterodensity profiling (AP) compares this density to an independently determined value in order to check the validity of the assumptions and ultimately derive useful parameters. Several physical effects can cause said assumptions to become invalid, with the most well-known example being the so-called photoeccentric effect. In this work, we provide analytic expressions for five other effects which induce AP deviations: the photoblend, -spot, -timing, -duration and -mass effects. We find that these effects can easily reproduce large AP deviations and so we caution that extracting the eccentricity distribution is only viable with careful consideration of the prior distributions for these other effects. We also re-investigate the photoeccentric effect and derive a single-domain minimum eccentricity expression and the parameter range for which analytic formulae are valid. The latter result shows that the assumptions underlying the analytic model for the photoeccentric effect break down for close-in, highly eccentric planets, meaning that extreme care must be taken in this regime. Finally, we demonstrate that contaminated light fraction can be solved for, indicating that AP could be a potent tool for planet validation.},

	Abstract = {Context. Hot Jupiters are still a fascinating exoplanet population that presents a diversity we are still far from understanding. High-precision photometric observations combined with radial velocity measurements give us a unique opportunity to constrain their properties better, on both their internal structure and their atmospheric bulk properties.  Aims: We initiated a follow-up program of Kepler-released planet candidates with the goal of confirming the planetary nature of a number of them through radial velocity measurements. For those that successfully passed the radial velocity screening, we furthermore performed a detailed exploration of their properties to characterize the systems. As a byproduct, these systematic observations allow us to consolidate the exoplanets' occurrence rate.  Methods: We performed a complete analysis of the Kepler-412 system, listed as planet candidate KOI-202 in the Kepler catalog, by combining the Kepler observations from Q1 to Q15, to ground-based spectroscopic observations that allowed us to derive radial velocity measurements, together with the host-star parameters and properties. We also analyzed the light curve to derive the star's rotation period and the phase function of the planet, including the secondary eclipse.  Results: We secured the planetary nature of Kepler-412b. We found the planet has a mass of 0.939 $\pm$ 0.085MJup and a radius of 1.325 $\pm$ 0.043RJup, which makes it a member of the bloated giant subgroup. It orbits its G3 V host star in 1.72 days. The system has an isochronal age of 5.1 Gyr, consistent with its moderate stellar activity as observed in the Kepler light curve and the rotation of the star of 17.2 $\pm$ 1.6 days. From the detected secondary we derived the day-side temperature as a function of the geometric albedo. We estimated that the geometrical albedo Ag should be between 0.094 $\pm$ 0.015 and 0.013+0.017-0.013 and the brightness of the day side 2380 $\pm$ 40 K. The measured night-side flux corresponds to a night-side brightness temperature of 2154 $\pm$ 83 K, much greater than what is expected for a planet with homogeneous heat redistribution. From the comparison to star and planet evolution models, we found that dissipation should operate in the deep interior of the planet. This modeling also shows that despite its inflated radius, the planet presents a noticeable amount of heavy elements, which accounts for a mass fraction of 0.11 $\pm$ 0.04.},

	Abstract = {Over the last twenty years, the search for extrasolar planets revealed us the rich diversity of the outcomes of the formation and evolution of planetary systems. In order to fully understand how these extrasolar planets came to be, however, the orbital and physical data we possess are not enough, and they need to be complemented with information on the composition of the exoplanets. Ground-based and space-based observations provided the first data on the atmospheric composition of a few extrasolar planets, but a larger and more detailed sample is required before we can fully take advantage of it. The primary goal of the Exoplanet Characterization Observatory (EChO) is to fill this gap, expanding the limited data we possess by performing a systematic survey of hundreds of extrasolar planets. The full exploitation of the data that EChO and other space-based and ground-based facilities will provide in the near future, however, requires the knowledge of what are the sources and sinks of the chemical species and molecules that will be observed. Luckily, the study of the past history of the Solar System provides several indications on the effects of processes like migration, late accretion and secular impacts, and on the time they occur in the life of planetary systems. In this work we will review what is already known about the factors influencing the composition of planetary atmospheres, focusing on the case of gaseous giant planets, and what instead still need to be investigated.},

We demonstrate this GEI with global 3D and 2D self-gravitating disk-planet simulations using the ZEUS, PLUTO and FARGO hydrodynamic codes. High resolution 2D simulations show that an unstable outer gap edge can lead to outward migration. Our results have important implications for theories of giant planet formation in massive disks.},

@article{Marcy:2014,
	Abstract = {We report on the masses, sizes, and orbits of the planets orbiting 22 Kepler stars. There are 49 planet candidates around these stars, including 42 detected through transits and 7 revealed by precise Doppler measurements of the host stars. Based on an analysis of the Kepler brightness measurements, along with high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy, Doppler spectroscopy, and (for 11 stars) asteroseismology, we establish low false-positive probabilities (FPPs) for all of the transiting planets (41 of 42 have an FPP under 1%), and we constrain their sizes and masses. Most of the transiting planets are smaller than three times the size of Earth. For 16 planets, the Doppler signal was securely detected, providing a direct measurement of the planet's mass. For the other 26 planets we provide either marginal mass measurements or upper limits to their masses and densities; in many cases we can rule out a rocky composition. We identify six planets with densities above 5 g cm-3, suggesting a mostly rocky interior for them. Indeed, the only planets that are compatible with a purely rocky composition are smaller than ~2 R ⊕. Larger planets evidently contain a larger fraction of low-density material (H, He, and H2O).  Based in part on observations obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated by the University of California and the California Institute of Technology.},

	Abstract = {Many exoplanets in close-in orbits are observed to have relatively high eccentricities and large stellar obliquities. We explore the possibility that these result from planet-planet scattering by studying the dynamical outcomes from a large number of orbit integrations in systems with two and three gas-giant planets in close-in orbits (0.05 AU < a < 0.15 AU). We find that at these orbital separations, unstable systems starting with low eccentricities and mutual inclinations (e <~ 0.1, i <~ 0.1) generally lead to planet-planet collisions in which the collision product is a planet on a low-eccentricity, low-inclination orbit. This result is inconsistent with the observations. We conclude that eccentricity and inclination excitation from planet-planet scattering must precede migration of planets into short-period orbits. This result constrains theories of planet migration: the semi-major axis must shrink by 1-2 orders of magnitude without damping the eccentricity and inclination.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the physics of gas giants requires knowledge about the behavior of hydrogen at extreme pressures and temperatures. Molecular hydrogen in these planets is supercritical, and has been considered as a physically homogeneous state where no differences can be made between a liquid and a gas and where all properties undergo no marked or distinct changes with pressure and temperature, the picture believed to hold below the dissociation and metallization transition. Here, we show that in Jupiter and Saturn, supercritical molecular hydrogen undergoes a dynamic transition around 10 GPa and 3000 K from the "rigid" liquid state to the "nonrigid" gas-like fluid state at the Frenkel line recently proposed, with the accompanying qualitative changes of all major physical properties. The consequences of this finding are discussed, including a physically justified way to demarcate the interior and the atmosphere in gas giants.},

@article{Heng:2013,
	Abstract = {Unlike previously explored relationships between the properties of hot Jovian atmospheres, the geometric albedo and the incident stellar flux do not exhibit a clear correlation, as revealed by our re-analysis of Q0-Q14 Kepler data. If the albedo is primarily associated with the presence of clouds in these irradiated atmospheres, a holistic modeling approach needs to relate the following properties: the strength of stellar irradiation (and hence the strength and depth of atmospheric circulation), the geometric albedo (which controls both the fraction of starlight absorbed and the pressure level at which it is predominantly absorbed), and the properties of the embedded cloud particles (which determine the albedo). The anticipated diversity in cloud properties renders any correlation between the geometric albedo and the stellar flux weak and characterized by considerable scatter. In the limit of vertically uniform populations of scatterers and absorbers, we use an analytical model and scaling relations to relate the temperature-pressure profile of an irradiated atmosphere and the photon deposition layer and to estimate whether a cloud particle will be lofted by atmospheric circulation. We derive an analytical formula for computing the albedo spectrum in terms of the cloud properties, which we compare to the measured albedo spectrum of HD 189733b by Evans et al. Furthermore, we show that whether an optical phase curve is flat or sinusoidal depends on whether the particles are small or large as defined by the Knudsen number. This may be an explanation for why Kepler-7b exhibits evidence for the longitudinal variation in abundance of condensates, while Kepler-12b shows no evidence for the presence of condensates despite the incident stellar flux being similar for both exoplanets. We include an "observer's cookbook" for deciphering various scenarios associated with the optical phase curve, the peak offset of the infrared phase curve, and the geometric albedo.},

@article{Demory:2013,
	Abstract = {We present new visible and infrared observations of the hot Jupiter Kepler-7b to determine its atmospheric properties. Our analysis allows us to (1) refine Kepler-7b's relatively large geometric albedo of Ag = 0.35 $\pm$ 0.02, (2) place upper limits on Kepler-7b thermal emission that remains undetected in both Spitzer bandpasses and (3) report a westward shift in the Kepler optical phase curve. We argue that Kepler-7b's visible flux cannot be due to thermal emission or Rayleigh scattering from H2 molecules. We therefore conclude that high altitude, optically reflective clouds located west from the substellar point are present in its atmosphere. We find that a silicate-based cloud composition is a possible candidate. Kepler-7b exhibits several properties that may make it particularly amenable to cloud formation in its upper atmosphere. These include a hot deep atmosphere that avoids a cloud cold trap, very low surface gravity to suppress cloud sedimentation, and a planetary equilibrium temperature in a range that allows for silicate clouds to potentially form in the visible atmosphere probed by Kepler. Our analysis does not only present evidence of optically thick clouds on Kepler-7b but also yields the first map of clouds in an exoplanet atmosphere.},

@article{Rauscher:2014,
	Abstract = {As a planet ages, it cools and its radius shrinks at a rate set by the efficiency with which heat is transported from the interior out to space. The bottleneck for this transport is at the boundary between the convective interior and the radiative atmosphere; the opacity there sets the global cooling rate. Models of planetary evolution are often one dimensional (1D), such that the radiative-convective boundary (RCB) is defined by a single temperature, pressure, and opacity. In reality the spatially inhomogeneous stellar heating pattern and circulation in the atmosphere could deform the RCB, allowing heat from the interior to escape more efficiently through regions with lower opacity. We present an analysis of the degree to which the RCB could be deformed and the resultant change in the evolutionary cooling rate. In this initial work we calculate the upper limit for this effect by comparing an atmospheric structure in local radiative equilibrium to its 1D equivalent. We find that the cooling through an uneven RCB could be enhanced over cooling through a uniform RCB by as much as 10%-50%. We also show that the deformation of the RCB (and the enhancement of the cooling rate) increases with a greater incident stellar flux or a lower inner entropy. Our results indicate that this mechanism could significantly change a planet's thermal evolution, causing it to cool and shrink more quickly than would otherwise be expected. This may exacerbate the well-known difficulty in explaining the very large radii observed for some hot Jupiters.},

	Abstract = {Secondary eclipse spectroscopy provides invaluable insights into the temperatures and compositions of exoplanetary atmospheres. We carry out a systematic temperature and abundance retrieval analysis of nine exoplanets (HD 189733b, HD 209458b, HD 149026b, GJ436b, WASP-12b, WASP-19b, WASP-43b, TrES-2b, and TrES-3b) observed in secondary eclipse using a combination of space- and ground-based facilities. Our goal with this analysis is to provide a consistent set of temperatures and compositions from which self-consistent models can be compared and to probe the underlying processes that shape these atmospheres. This paper is the second in a three part series of papers exploring the retrievability of temperatures and abundances from secondary eclipse spectra and the implications of these results for the chemistry of exoplanet atmospheres. In this investigation we present a catalogue of temperatures and abundances for H2O, CH4, CO, and CO2. We find that our temperatures and abundances are generally consistent with those of previous studies, although we do not find any statistically convincing evidence for super-solar C to O ratios (e.g., solar C/O falls in the 1sigma confidence intervals in eight of the nine planets in our sample). Furthermore, within our sample we find little evidence for thermal inversions over a wide range of effective temperatures (with the exception of HD 209458b), consistent with previous investigations. The lack of evidence for inversions for most planets in our sample over such a wide range of effective temperatures provides additional support for the hypothesis that TiO is unlikely to be the absorber responsible for the formation of these inversions.},

	Abstract = {Chemical disequilibrium has recently become a relevant topic in the study of the atmospheres of transiting extrasolar planets, brown dwarfs, and directly imaged exoplanets. We present a new way of assessing whether or not a Jovian-like atmosphere is in chemical disequilibrium from observations of detectable or inferred gases such as H2O, CH4, CO, and H2. Our hypothesis, based on previous kinetic modeling studies, is that cooler atmospheres will show stronger signs of disequilibrium than hotter atmospheres. We verify this with chemistry-transport models and show that planets with temperatures less than ~1200 K are likely to show the strongest signs of disequilibrium due to the vertical quenching of CO, and that our new approach is able to capture this process. We also find that in certain instances a planetary composition may appear in equilibrium when it actually is not due to the degeneracy in the shape of the vertical mixing ratio profiles. We determine the state of disequilibrium in eight exoplanets using the results from secondary eclipse temperature and abundance retrievals. We find that all of the planets in our sample are consistent with thermochemical equilibrium to within 3sigma. Future observations are needed to further constrain the abundances in order to definitively identify disequilibrium in exoplanet atmospheres.},

@article{Greenberg:2013,
	Abstract = {In a multiplanet system, tides acting on the inner planet can significantly affect the orbital evolution of the entire system. While tides usually damp eccentricities, a novel mechanism identified by Correia et al. (Astrophys J Lett 744, article id. L23, 2012) tends to raise eccentricities as a result of the tides' effect on the inner planet's rotation. Our analytical description of this spin-driven tidal (SDT) effect shows that, while the inner planet's eccentricity undergoes pumping, the process is more completely described by an exchange of strength between the two eigenmodes of the dynamical system. Our analysis allows derivation of criteria for two-planet coplanar systems where the SDT effect can reverse tidal damping, and may preclude the effect's being significant for realistic systems. For the specific case quantified by Correia et al., the effect is strong because of the large adopted tidal time lag, which may not be appropriate for the assumed Saturn-like inner planet. On the other hand, the effective for any given planet in exotic circumstances is very uncertain, so the SDT effect could play a role in planetary evolution.},

Furthermore, the validation of the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation in this regime is discussed, showing the importance of choosing the effective atomic diameter.

@article{Kipping:2012,
	Abstract = {We present a novel method to determine eccentricity constraints of extrasolar planets in systems with multiple transiting planets through photometry alone. Our method is highly model independent, making no assumptions about the stellar parameters and requiring no radial velocity, transit timing or occultation events. Our technique exploits the fact the light-curve-derived stellar density must be the same for all planets transiting a common star. Assuming a circular orbit, the derived stellar density departs from the true value by a predictable factor, Psi, which contains information on the eccentricity of the system. By comparing multiple stellar densities, any differences must be due to eccentricity and thus meaningful constraints can be placed in the absence of any other information. The technique, called 'Multibody Asterodensity Profiling' (MAP), is a new observable which can be used alone or in combination with other observables, such as radial velocities and transit timing variations. An eccentricity prior can also be included as desired. MAP is most sensitive to the minimum pair-combined eccentricity e.g. (e1+e2)min. Individual eccentricity constraints are less stringent but an empirical eccentricity posterior is always derivable and is freely available from transit photometry alone.  We present a description of our technique using both analytic and numerical implementations, followed by two example analyses on synthetic photometry as a proof of principle. We point out that MAP has the potential to constrain the eccentricity, and thus habitability, of Earth-like planets in the absence of radial velocity data, which is likely for terrestrial-mass objects.},

	Abstract = {The last decade has seen the discovery of more than a thousand exoplanets but, more excitingly, probing their atmospheres has become possible. With current data we caught a glimpse of the diversity of exoplanet atmospheres that will be revealed in the next years. However, numerous questions concerning their chemical composition, thermal structure, and atmospheric dynamics remain to be answered. More observations of higher quality are needed. The Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory (EChO) is a space-based observatory dedicated to the characterization of exoplanets atmospheres proposed to the ESA cosmic vision program. With its large spectral coverage (4-16 {\mu}m) and high spectral resolution (\Delta{\lambda}/{\lambda}>300 below 5 {\mu}m and \Delta{\lambda}/{\lambda}>30 above 5 {\mu}m) EChO will provide spectrally resolved transit lightcurves, secondary eclipses lightcurves, and full phase curves of numerous exoplanets with an unprecedented signal to noise ratio. In this technical note we review some of today's main scientific questions about gas giant exoplanets atmospheres, for which EChO will bring a decisive contribution.},

	Abstract = {Among the group of extrasolar planets, transiting planets provide a great opportunity to obtain direct measurements for the basic physical properties, such as mass and radius of these objects. These planets are therefore highly important in the understanding of the evolution and formation of planetary systems: from the observations of photometric transits, the interior structure of the planet and atmospheric properties can also be constrained. The most efficient way to search for transiting extrasolar planets is based on wide-field surveys by hunting for short and shallow periodic dips in light curves covering quite long time intervals. These surveys monitor fields with several degrees in diameter and tens or hundreds of thousands of objects simultaneously. In the practice of astronomical observations, surveys of large field-of-view are rather new and therefore require special methods for photometric data reduction that have not been used before. Since 2004, I participate in the HATNet project, one of the leading initiatives in the competitive search for transiting planets. Due to the lack of software solution which is capable to handle and properly reduce the yield of such a wide-field survey, I have started to develop a new package designed to perform the related data processing and analysis. After several years of improvement, the software package became suffi ciently robust and played a key role in the discovery of several transiting planets. In addition, various new algorithms for data reduction had to be developed, implemented and tested which were relevant during the reduction and the interpretation of data. In this PhD thesis, I summarize my efforts related to the development of a complete software solution for high precision photometric reduction of astronomical images. I also demonstrate the role of this newly developed package and the related algorithms in the case of particular discoveries of the HATNet project.},

	Abstract = {We present refined parameters for the extrasolar planetary system HAT-P-2 (also known as HD147506), based on new radial velocity and photometric data. HAT-P-2b is a transiting extrasolar planet that exhibits an eccentric orbit. We present a detailed analysis of the planetary and stellar parameters, yielding consistent results for the mass and radius of the star, better constraints on the orbital eccentricity and refined planetary parameters. The improved parameters for the host star are M* = 1.36 +/- 0.04Msolar and R* = 1.64 +/- 0.08 Rsolar, while the planet has a mass of Mp = 9.09 +/- 0.24MJup and radius of Rp = 1.16 +/- 0.08RJup. The refined transit epoch and period for the planet are E = 2454387.49375 +/- 0.00074(BJD) and P = 5.6334729 +/- 0.0000061(d), and the orbital eccentricity and argument of periastron are e = 0.5171 +/- 0.0033 and . These orbital elements allow us to predict the timings of secondary eclipses with a reasonable accuracy of ~15min. We also discuss the effects of this significant eccentricity including the characterization of the asymmetry in the transit light curve. Simple formulae are presented for the above, and these, in turn, can be used to constrain the orbital eccentricity using purely photometric data. These will be particularly useful for very high precision, space-borne observations of transiting planets.},

	Abstract = {We present revised properties for 196,468 stars observed by the NASA Kepler mission and used in the analysis of Quarter 1-16 (Q1-Q16) data to detect and characterize transiting planets. The catalog is based on a compilation of literature values for atmospheric properties (temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity) derived from different observational techniques (photometry, spectroscopy, asteroseismology, and exoplanet transits), which were then homogeneously fitted to a grid of Dartmouth stellar isochrones. We use broadband photometry and asteroseismology to characterize 11,532 Kepler targets which were previously unclassified in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). We report the detection of oscillations in 2762 of these targets, classifying them as giant stars and increasing the number of known oscillating giant stars observed by Kepler by ~20% to a total of ~15,500 stars. Typical uncertainties in derived radii and masses are ~40% and ~20%, respectively, for stars with photometric constraints only, and 5%-15% and ~10% for stars based on spectroscopy and/or asteroseismology, although these uncertainties vary strongly with spectral type and luminosity class. A comparison with the Q1-Q12 catalog shows a systematic decrease in radii of M dwarfs, while radii for K dwarfs decrease or increase depending on the Q1-Q12 provenance (KIC or Yonsei-Yale isochrones). Radii of F-G dwarfs are on average unchanged, with the exception of newly identified giants. The Q1-Q16 star properties catalog is a first step toward an improved characterization of all Kepler targets to support planet-occurrence studies.},

	Abstract = {Stars hosting hot Jupiters are often observed to have high obliquities, whereas stars with multiple coplanar planets have been seen to have low obliquities. This has been interpreted as evidence that hot-Jupiter formation is linked to dynamical disruption, as opposed to planet migration through a protoplanetary disk. We used asteroseismology to measure a large obliquity for Kepler-56, a red giant star hosting two transiting coplanar planets. These observations show that spin-orbit misalignments are not confined to hot-Jupiter systems. Misalignments in a broader class of systems had been predicted as a consequence of torques from wide-orbiting companions, and indeed radial velocity measurements revealed a third companion in a wide orbit in the Kepler-56 system.},

	Abstract = {We have used asteroseismology to determine fundamental properties for 66 Kepler planet-candidate host stars, with typical uncertainties of 3% and 7% in radius and mass, respectively. The results include new asteroseismic solutions for four host stars with confirmed planets (Kepler-4, Kepler-14, Kepler-23 and Kepler-25) and increase the total number of Kepler host stars with asteroseismic solutions to 77. A comparison with stellar properties in the planet-candidate catalog by Batalha et al. shows that radii for subgiants and giants obtained from spectroscopic follow-up are systematically too low by up to a factor of 1.5, while the properties for unevolved stars are in good agreement. We furthermore apply asteroseismology to confirm that a large majority of cool main-sequence hosts are indeed dwarfs and not misclassified giants. Using the revised stellar properties, we recalculate the radii for 107 planet candidates in our sample, and comment on candidates for which the radii change from a previously giant-planet/brown-dwarf/stellar regime to a sub-Jupiter size or vice versa. A comparison of stellar densities from asteroseismology with densities derived from transit models in Batalha et al. assuming circular orbits shows significant disagreement for more than half of the sample due to systematics in the modeled impact parameters or due to planet candidates that may be in eccentric orbits. Finally, we investigate tentative correlations between host-star masses and planet-candidate radii, orbital periods, and multiplicity, but caution that these results may be influenced by the small sample size and detection biases.},

@article{Seager:2003,
	Abstract = {There is a unique solution of the planet and star parameters from a planet transit light curve with two or more transits if the planet has a circular orbit and the light curve is observed in a bandpass where limb darkening is negligible. The existence of this unique solution is very useful for current planet transit surveys for several reasons. First, there is an analytic solution that allows a quick parameter estimate, in particular of Rp. Second, the stellar density can be uniquely derived from the transit light curve alone. The stellar density can then be used to immediately rule out a giant star (and hence a much larger than planetary companion) and can also be used to put an upper limit on the stellar and planet radius even considering slightly evolved stars. Third, the presence of an additional fully blended star that contaminates an eclipsing system to mimic a planet transit can be largely ruled out from the transit light curve given a spectral type for the central star. Fourth, the period can be estimated from a single-transit light curve and a measured spectral type. All of these applications can be used to select the best planet transit candidates for mass determination by radial velocity follow-up. To use these applications in practice, the photometric precision and time sampling of the light curve must be high (better than 0.005 mag precision and 5 minute time sampling for a two-transit light curve).},

	Abstract = {Aims: We report the discovery of a massive and dense transiting planet CoRoT-27b on a 3.58-day orbit around a 4.2 Gyr-old G2 star. The planet candidate was identified from the CoRoT photometry, and was confirmed as a planet with ground-based spectroscopy.  Methods: The confirmation of the planet candidate is based on radial velocity observations combined with imaging to rule out blends. The characterisation of the planet and its host star was carried out using a Bayesian approach where all the data (CoRoT photometry, radial velocities, and spectroscopic characterisation of the star) are used jointly. The Bayesian analysis included a study whether the assumption of white normally distributed noise holds for the CoRoT photometry and whether the use of a non-normal noise distribution offers advantages in parameter estimation and model selection.  Results: CoRoT-27b has a mass of 10.39 $\pm$ 0.55MJup, a radius of 1.01 $\pm$ 0.04RJup, a mean density of 12.6-1.67+1.92g cm-3, and an effective temperature of 1500 $\pm$ 130 K. The planet orbits around its host star, a 4.2 Gyr-old G2-star with a mass M* = 1.06M&sun; and a radius R* = 1.05R&sun;, on a 0.048 $\pm$ 0.007 AU orbit of 3.58 days. The radial velocity observations allow us to exclude highly eccentric orbits, namely, e < 0.065 with 99% confidence. Given its high mass and density, theoretical modelling of CoRoT-27b is demanding. We identify two solutions with heavy element mass fractions of 0.11 $\pm$ 0.08M⊕ and 0.07 $\pm$ 0.06M⊕, but even solutions void of heavy elements cannot be excluded. We carry out a secondary eclipse search from the CoRoT photometry using a method based on Bayesian model selection, but conclude that the noise level is too high to detect eclipses shallower than 9% of the transit depth. Using a non-normal noise model was shown not to affect the parameter estimation results, but led to significant improvement in the sensitivity of the model selection process.  The CoRoT space mission, launched on December 27, 2006, has been developed and is operated by the CNES, with the contribution of Austria, Belgium, Brazil, ESA (RSSD and Science Programme), Germany, and Spain.},

	Abstract = {We provide updates to the Kepler planet candidate sample based upon nearly two years of high-precision photometry (i.e., Q1-Q8). From an initial list of nearly 13,400 threshold crossing events, 480 new host stars are identified from their flux time series as consistent with hosting transiting planets. Potential transit signals are subjected to further analysis using the pixel-level data, which allows background eclipsing binaries to be identified through small image position shifts during transit. We also re-evaluate Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) 1-1609, which were identified early in the mission, using substantially more data to test for background false positives and to find additional multiple systems. Combining the new and previous KOI samples, we provide updated parameters for 2738 Kepler planet candidates distributed across 2017 host stars. From the combined Kepler planet candidates, 472 are new from the Q1-Q8 data examined in this study. The new Kepler planet candidates represent ~40% of the sample with R P ~ 1 R ⊕ and represent ~40% of the low equilibrium temperature (T eq < 300 K) sample. We review the known biases in the current sample of Kepler planet candidates relevant to evaluating planet population statistics with the current Kepler planet candidate sample.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of WASP-78b and WASP-79b, two highly-bloated Jupiter-mass exoplanets orbiting F-type host stars. WASP-78b orbits its V = 12.0 host star (TYC 5889-271-1) every 2.175 days and WASP-79b orbits its V = 10.1 host star (CD-30 1812) every 3.662 days. Planetary parameters have been determined using a simultaneous fit to WASP and TRAPPIST transit photometry and CORALIE radial-velocity measurements. For WASP-78b a planetary mass of 0.89 $\pm$ 0.08 MJup and a radius of 1.70 $\pm$ 0.11 RJup is found. The planetary equilibrium temperature of TP = 2350 $\pm$ 80 K for WASP-78b makes it one of the hottest of the currently known exoplanets. WASP-79b its found to have a planetary mass of 0.90 $\pm$ 0.08 MJup, but with a somewhat uncertain radius due to lack of sufficient TRAPPIST photometry. The planetary radius is at least 1.70 $\pm$ 0.11 RJup, but could be as large as 2.09 $\pm$ 0.14 RJup, which would make WASP-79b the largest known exoplanet.

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of two exoplanets transiting high-jitter stars. HAT-P-32b orbits the bright V = 11.289 late-F-early-G dwarf star GSC 3281-00800, with a period P = 2.150008 $\pm$ 0.000001 d. The stellar and planetary masses and radii depend on the eccentricity of the system, which is poorly constrained due to the high-velocity jitter (~80 m s-1). Assuming a circular orbit, the star has a mass of 1.16 $\pm$ 0.04 M &sun; and radius of 1.22 $\pm$ 0.02 R &sun;, while the planet has a mass of 0.860 $\pm$ 0.164 M J and a radius of 1.789 $\pm$ 0.025 R J. The second planet, HAT-P-33b, orbits the bright V = 11.188 late-F dwarf star GSC 2461-00988, with a period P = 3.474474 $\pm$ 0.000001 d. As for HAT-P-32, the stellar and planetary masses and radii of HAT-P-33 depend on the eccentricity, which is poorly constrained due to the high jitter (~50 m s-1). In this case, spectral line bisector spans (BSs) are significantly anti-correlated with the radial velocity residuals, and we are able to use this correlation to reduce the residual rms to ~35 m s-1. We find that the star has a mass of 1.38 $\pm$ 0.04 M &sun; and a radius of 1.64 $\pm$ 0.03 R &sun; while the planet has a mass of 0.762 $\pm$ 0.101 M J and a radius of 1.686 $\pm$ 0.045 R J for an assumed circular orbit. Due to the large BS variations exhibited by both stars we rely on detailed modeling of the photometric light curves to rule out blend scenarios. Both planets are among the largest radii transiting planets discovered to date.  Based in part on observations obtained at the W. M.

	Abstract = {We present a broad suite of models of extrasolar giant planets (EGPs), ranging in mass from 0.3 to 15 Jupiter masses. The models predict luminosity (both reflected and emitted) as a function of age, mass deuterium abundance, and distance from parent stars of various spectral types. We also explore the effects of helium mass fraction, rotation rate, and the presence of a rock-ice core. The models incorporate the most accurate available equation of state for the interior, including a new theory for the enhancement of deuterium fusion by electron screening, which is potentially important in these low-mass objects, The results of our calculations reveal enormous sensitivity of EGPs to the presence of the parent star, particularly for G and earlier spectral types. They also show a strong sensitivity of the flux contrast in the mid-infrared, between parent star and EGP, to the mass and age of the EGPs. We interpret our results in terms of search strategies for ground- and space-based observatories in place or anticipated in the near future.},

	Abstract = {We present new equations of state (EOS) for hydrogen and helium, intended for applications to low-mass stars (M < 1 Msun), brown dwarfs, and giant planets. They cover the range 2.10 <log T(K) < 7.06 and 4 <log P (dyn cm-2) < 19 and include new physical treatments of partial dissociation and ionization caused by both pressure and temperature effects. The hydrogen EOS is based on a careful study of nonideal interactions. In the case of helium, the principal features of the EOS physics are retained in a simplified model. The calculation is based on the free energy,minimization method, and a detailed account of the physical model has been published elsewhere. Mixtures of hydrogen and helium are obtained with the additive volume rule and an additional ideal entropy-of-mixing term. In this paper, we present extensive tabular results for both the H and He EOS, together with a critical analysis.  Part of this analysis is based on a comparison with other EOS commonly used in astrophysics. Both EOS everywhere satisfy the requirements of thermal and mechanical stability and are thermodynamically consistent over most of the phase diagram. A complete set of the tables is available in the AAS CD-ROM Series, Vol. 5, and by anonymous FTP.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of planetary systems is intimately linked to the evolution of their host star. Our understanding of the whole planetary evolution process is based on the large planet diversity observed so far. To date, only few tens of planets have been discovered orbiting stars ascending the Red Giant Branch. Although several theories have been proposed, the question of how planets die remains open due to the small number statistics. In this work we study the giant star Kepler-91 (KOI-2133) in order to determine the nature of a transiting companion. This system was detected by the Kepler Space Telescope. However, its planetary confirmation is needed. We confirm the planetary nature of the object transiting the star Kepler-91 by deriving a mass of $ M_p=0.88^{+0.17}_{-0.33} ~M_{\rm Jup}$ and a planetary radius of $R_p=1.384^{+0.011}_{-0.054} ~R_{\rm Jup}$. Asteroseismic analysis produces a stellar radius of $R_{\star}=6.30\pm 0.16 ~R_{\odot}$ and a mass of $M_{\star}=1.31\pm 0.10 ~ M_{\odot} $. We find that its eccentric orbit ($e=0.066^{+0.013}_{-0.017}$) is just $1.32^{+0.07}_{-0.22} ~ R_{\star}$ away from the stellar atmosphere at the pericenter. Kepler-91b could be the previous stage of the planet engulfment, recently detected for BD+48 740. Our estimations show that Kepler-91b will be swallowed by its host star in less than 55 Myr. Among the confirmed planets around giant stars, this is the planetary-mass body closest to its host star. At pericenter passage, the star subtends an angle of $48^{\circ}$, covering around 10% of the sky as seen from the planet. The planetary atmosphere seems to be inflated probably due to the high stellar irradiation.},

	Abstract = {We model the evolution of planets with various masses and compositions. We investigate the effects of the composition and its depth dependence on the long-term evolution of the planets. The effects of opacity and stellar irradiation are also considered. It is shown that the change in radius due to various compositions can be significantly smaller than the change in radius caused by the opacity. Irradiation also affects the planetary contraction but is found to be less important than the opacity effects. We suggest that the mass-radius relationship used for characterization of observed extrasolar planets should be taken with great caution since different physical conditions can result in very different mass-radius relationships.},

	Abstract = {Using density functional molecular dynamics simulations, we determine the equation of state (EOS) for hydrogen-helium mixtures spanning density-temperature conditions typical of giant-planet interiors, ~0.2-9 g cm-3 and 1000-80,000 K for a typical helium mass fraction of 0.245. In addition to computing internal energy and pressure, we determine the entropy using an ab initio thermodynamic integration technique. A comprehensive EOS table with 391 density-temperature points is constructed and the results are presented in the form of a two-dimensional free energy fit for interpolation. Deviations between our ab initio EOS and the semi-analytical EOS model by Saumon and Chabrier are analyzed in detail, and we use the results for initial revision of the inferred thermal state of giant planets with known values for mass and radius. Changes are most pronounced for planets in the Jupiter mass range and below. We present a revision to the mass-radius relationship that makes the hottest exoplanets increase in radius by ~0.2 Jupiter radii at fixed entropy and for masses greater than ~0.5 Jupiter mass. This change is large enough to have possible implications for some discrepant "inflated giant exoplanets."},

@article{Spiegel:2013,
	Abstract = {There have been many proposed explanations for the larger-than-expected radii of some transiting hot Jupiters, including either stellar or orbital energy deposition deep in the atmosphere or deep in the interior. In this paper, we explore the important influences on hot-Jupiter radius evolution of (1) additional heat sources in the high atmosphere, the deep atmosphere, and deep in the convective interior; (2) consistent cooling of the deep interior through the planetary dayside, nightside, and poles; (3) the degree of heat redistribution to the nightside; and (4) the presence of an upper atmosphere absorber inferred to produce anomalously hot upper atmospheres and inversions in some close-in giant planets. In particular, we compare the radius expansion effects of atmospheric and deep-interior heating at the same power levels and derive the power required to achieve a given radius increase when night-side cooling is incorporated. We find that models that include consistent day/night cooling are more similar to isotropically irradiated models when there is more heat redistributed from the dayside to the nightside. In addition, we consider the efficacy of ohmic heating in the atmosphere and/or convective interior in inflating hot Jupiters. Among our conclusions are that (1) the most highly irradiated planets cannot stably have uB >~ 10 km s-1 G over a large fraction of their daysides, where u is the zonal wind speed and B is the dipolar magnetic field strength in the atmosphere, and (2) that ohmic heating cannot in and of itself lead to a runaway in planet radius.},

	Abstract = {One of the persistent complications in searches for transiting exoplanets is the low percentage of the detected candidates that ultimately prove to be planets, which significantly increases the load on the telescopes used for the follow-up observations to confirm or reject candidates. Several attempts have been made at creating techniques that can pare down candidate lists without the need of additional observations. Some of these techniques involve a detailed analysis of light curve characteristics; others estimate the stellar density or some proxy thereof. In this paper, we extend upon this second approach, exploring the use of independently calculated stellar densities to identify the most promising transiting exoplanet candidates. We use a set of CoRoT candidates and the set of known transiting exoplanets to examine the potential of this approach. In particular, we note the possibilities inherent in the high-precision photometry from space missions, which can detect stellar asteroseismic pulsations from which accurate stellar densities can be extracted without additional observations.},

@article{Laughlin:2011,
	Abstract = {We present a systematic evaluation of the agreement between the observed radii of 90 well-characterized transiting extrasolar giant planets and their corresponding model radii. Our model radii are drawn from previously published calculations of coreless giant planets that have attained their asymptotic radii, and which have been tabulated for a range of planet masses and equilibrium temperatures. (We report a two-dimensional polynomial fitting function that accurately represents the models.) As expected, the model radii provide a statistically significant improvement over a null hypothesis that the sizes of giant planets are completely independent of mass and effective temperature. As is well known, however, fiducial models provide an insufficient explanation; the planetary radius anomalies, R ≡ R_obs-R_pred, are strongly correlated with planetary equilibrium temperature. We find that the radius anomalies have a best-fit dependence, R∝ T_eff^{alpha}, with alpha = 1.4 $\pm$ 0.6. Incorporating this relation into the model radii leads to substantially less scatter in the radius correlation. The extra temperature dependence represents an important constraint on theoretical models for hot Jupiters. Using simple scaling arguments, we find support for the hypothesis of Batygin & Stevenson that this correlation can be attributed to a planetary heating mechanism that is mediated by magnetohydrodynamic coupling between the planetary magnetic field and near-surface flow that is accompanied by ohmic dissipation at adiabatic depth. Additionally, we find that the temperature dependence is likely too strong to admit kinetic heating as the primary source of anomalous energy generation within the majority of the observed transiting planets.},

@article{Almenara:2013,
	Abstract = {We report the discovery of two transiting exoplanets, CoRoT-25b and CoRoT-26b, both of low density, one of which is in the Saturn mass-regime. For each star, ground-based complementary observations through optical photometry and radial velocity measurements secured the planetary nature of the transiting body and allowed us to fully characterize them. For CoRoT-25b we found a planetary mass of 0.27 $\pm$ 0.04 MJup, a radius of 1.08-0.10+0.3 RJup and hence a mean density of 0.15-0.06+0.15 g cm-3. The planet orbits an F9 main-sequence star in a 4.86-day period, that has a V magnitude of 15.0, solar metallicity, and an age of 4.5-2.0+1.8-Gyr. CoRoT-26b orbits a slightly evolved G5 star of 9.06 $\pm$ 1.5-Gyr age in a 4.20-day period that hassolar metallicity and a V magnitude of 15.8. With a mass of 0.52 $\pm$ 0.05 MJup, a radius of 1.26-0.07+0.13 RJup, and a mean density of 0.28-0.07+0.09 g cm-3, it belongs to the low-mass hot-Jupiter population. Planetary evolution models allowed us to estimate a core mass of a few tens of Earth mass for the two planets with heavy-element mass fractions of 0.52-0.15+0.08 and 0.26-0.08+0.05, respectively, assuming that a small fraction of the incoming flux is dissipated at the center of the planet. In addition, these models indicate that CoRoT-26b is anomalously large compared with what standard models could account for, indicating that dissipation from stellar heating could cause this size.  The CoRoT space mission, launched on December 27th 2006, has been developed and is operated by CNES, with the contribution of Austria, Belgium, Brazil, ESA (RSSD and Science Programme), Germany and Spain.

	Abstract = {The cesam code is a consistent set of programs and routines which perform calculations of 1D quasi-hydrostatic stellar evolution including microscopic diffusion of chemical species and diffusion of angular momentum. The solution of the quasi-static equilibrium is performed by a collocation method based on piecewise polynomials approximations projected on a B-spline basis; that allows stable and robust calculations, and the exact restitution of the solution, not only at grid points, even for the discontinuous variables. Other advantages are the monitoring by only one parameter of the accuracy and its improvement by super-convergence. An automatic mesh refinement has been designed for adjusting the localisations of grid points according to the changes of unknowns. For standard models, the evolution of the chemical composition is solved by stiffly stable schemes of orders up to four; in the convection zones mixing and evolution of chemical are simultaneous. The solution of the diffusion equation employs the Galerkin finite elements scheme; the mixing of chemicals is then performed by a strong turbulent diffusion. A precise restoration of the atmosphere is allowed for.},

	Abstract = {We present the updated version of the code used to compute stellar evolutionary tracks in Padova. It is the result of a thorough revision of the major input physics, together with the inclusion of the pre-main sequence phase, not present in our previous releases of stellar models. Another innovative aspect is the possibility of promptly generating accurate opacity tables fully consistent with any selected initial chemical composition, by coupling the Opacity Project At Livermore (OPAL) data at high temperatures to the molecular opacities computed with our {\ae}SOPUS code. In this work, we present extended sets of stellar evolutionary models for various initial chemical compositions, while other sets with different metallicities and/or different distributions of heavy elements are being computed. For the present release of models, we adopt the solar distribution of heavy elements from the recent revision by Caffau et al., corresponding to a Sun's metallicity Z ~= 0.0152. From all computed sets of stellar tracks, we also derive isochrones in several photometric systems. The aim is to provide the community with the basic tools to model star clusters and galaxies by means of population synthesis techniques.},

	Abstract = {We present the detection and characterization of the two new transiting, close-in, giant extrasolar planets KOI-200 b and KOI-889 b. They were first identified by the Kepler team as promising candidates from photometry of the Kepler satellite; we then established their planetary nature thanks to the radial velocity follow-up jointly secured with the spectrographs SOPHIE and HARPS-N. Combined analyses of the whole datasets allow the two planetary systems to be characterized. The planet KOI-200 b has mass and radius of 0.68 $\pm$ 0.09 MJup and 1.32 $\pm$ 0.14 RJup; it orbits in 7.34 days a F8V host star with mass and radius of 1.40-0.11+0.14 M&sun; and 1.51 $\pm$ 0.14 R&sun;. The planet KOI-889 b is a massive planet with mass and radius of 9.9 $\pm$ 0.5 MJup and 1.03 $\pm$ 0.06 RJup; it orbits in 8.88 days an active G8V star with a rotation period of 19.2 $\pm$ 0.3 days, and mass and radius of 0.88 $\pm$ 0.06 M&sun; and 0.88 $\pm$ 0.04 R&sun;. Both planets lie on eccentric orbits and are located just at the frontier between regimes where tides can explain circularization and where tidal effects are negligible. The two planets are among the first detected and characterized thanks to observations secured with HARPS-N, the new spectrograph recently mounted at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. These results illustrate the benefits that could be obtained from joint studies using two spectrographs as SOPHIE and HARPS-N.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of a massive planet (Mpsini=13.02+/-0.64 MJ; total mass = 13.25+/-0.64 MJ), large (1.95+/-0.16 RJ) planet in a transiting, eccentric orbit (e=0.260+/-0.017) around a 10th magnitude F5 V star in the constellation Camelopardalis. We designate the planet XO-3b and the star XO-3, also known as GSC 03727-01064. The orbital period of XO-3b is 3.1915426+/-0.00014 days. XO-3 lacks a trigonometric parallax; we estimate its distance to be 260+/-23 pc. The radius of XO-3 is 2.13+/-0.21 Rsolar, its mass is 1.41+/-0.08 Msolar, its vsini=18.54+/-0.17 km s-1, and its metallicity is [Fe/H]=-0.177+/-0.027. This system is unusual for a number of reasons. XO-3b is one of the most massive planets discovered around any star for which the orbital period is less than 10 days. The mass is near the deuterium-burning limit of 13 MJ, which is a proposed boundary between planets and brown dwarfs. Although Burrows et al. propose that formation in a disk or formation in the interstellar medium in a manner similar to stars is a more logical way to differentiate planets and brown dwarfs, our current observations are not adequate to address this distinction. XO-3b is also unusual in that its eccentricity is large given its relatively short orbital period. Both the planetary radius and the inclination are functions of the spectroscopically determined stellar radius. Analysis of the transit light curve of XO-3b suggests that the spectroscopically derived parameters may be overestimated. Though relatively noisy, the light curves favor a smaller radius in order to better match the steepness of the ingress and egress. The light curve fits imply a planetary radius of 1.25+/-0.15 RJ, which would correspond to a mass of 12.03+/-0.46 MJ. A precise trigonometric parallax measurement or a very accurate light curve is needed to resolve the uncertainty in the planetary mass and radius.},

	Abstract = {The `hot Jupiters' that abound in lists of known extrasolar planets are thought to have formed far from their host stars, but migrate inwards through interactions with the proto-planetary disk from which they were born, or by an alternative mechanism such as planet-planet scattering. The hot Jupiters closest to their parent stars, at orbital distances of only ~0.02 astronomical units, have strong tidal interactions, and systems such as OGLE-TR-56 have been suggested as tests of tidal dissipation theory. Here we report the discovery of planet WASP-18b with an orbital period of 0.94days and a mass of ten Jupiter masses (10MJup), resulting in a tidal interaction an order of magnitude stronger than that of planet OGLE-TR-56b. Under the assumption that the tidal-dissipation parameter Q of the host star is of the order of 106, as measured for Solar System bodies and binary stars and as often applied to extrasolar planets, WASP-18b will be spiralling inwards on a timescale less than a thousandth that of the lifetime of its host star. Therefore either WASP-18 is in a rare, exceptionally short-lived state, or the tidal dissipation in this system (and possibly other hot-Jupiter systems) must be much weaker than in the Solar System.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of four relatively massive (2-7 M J) transiting extrasolar planets. HAT-P-20b orbits the moderately bright V = 11.339 K3 dwarf star GSC 1910-00239 on a circular orbit, with a period P = 2.875317 $\pm$ 0.000004 days, transit epoch Tc = 2455080.92661 $\pm$ 0.00021 (BJDUTC), and transit duration 0.0770 $\pm$ 0.0008 days. The host star has a mass of 0.76 $\pm$ 0.03 M &sun;, radius of 0.69 $\pm$ 0.02 R &sun;, effective temperature 4595 $\pm$ 80 K, and metallicity [Fe/H] = +0.35 $\pm$ 0.08. The planetary companion has a mass of 7.246 $\pm$ 0.187 M J and a radius of 0.867 $\pm$ 0.033 R J yielding a mean density of 13.78 $\pm$ 1.50 g cm-3. HAT-P-21b orbits the V = 11.685 G3 dwarf star GSC 3013-01229 on an eccentric (e = 0.228 $\pm$ 0.016) orbit, with a period P = 4.124481 $\pm$ 0.000007 days, transit epoch Tc = 2454996.41312 $\pm$ 0.00069, and transit duration 0.1530 $\pm$ 0.0027 days. The host star has a mass of 0.95 $\pm$ 0.04 M &sun;, radius of 1.10 $\pm$ 0.08 R &sun;, effective temperature 5588 $\pm$ 80 K, and metallicity [Fe/H] = +0.01 $\pm$ 0.08. The planetary companion has a mass of 4.063 $\pm$ 0.161 M J and a radius of 1.024 $\pm$ 0.092 R J yielding a mean density of 4.68+1.59 - 0.99 g cm-3. HAT-P-21b is a borderline object between the pM and pL class planets, and the transits occur near apastron. HAT-P-22b orbits the bright V = 9.732 G5 dwarf star HD 233731 on a circular orbit, with a period P = 3.212220 $\pm$ 0.000009 days, transit epoch Tc = 2454930.22001 $\pm$ 0.00025, and transit duration 0.1196 $\pm$ 0.0014 days. The host star has a mass of 0.92 $\pm$ 0.03 M &sun;, radius of 1.04 $\pm$ 0.04 R &sun;, effective temperature 5302 $\pm$ 80 K, and metallicity [Fe/H] = +0.24 $\pm$ 0.08. The planet has a mass of 2.147 $\pm$ 0.061 M J and a compact radius of 1.080 $\pm$ 0.058 R J yielding a mean density of 2.11+0.40 - 0.29 g cm-3. The host star also harbors an M-dwarf companion at a wide separation. Finally, HAT-P-23b orbits the V = 12.432 G0 dwarf star GSC 1632-01396 on a close to circular orbit, with a period P = 1.212884 $\pm$ 0.000002 days, transit epoch Tc = 2454852.26464 $\pm$ 0.00018, and transit duration 0.0908 $\pm$ 0.0007 days. The host star has a mass of 1.13 $\pm$ 0.04 M &sun;, radius of 1.20 $\pm$ 0.07 R &sun;, effective temperature 5905 $\pm$ 80 K, and metallicity [Fe/H] = +0.15 $\pm$ 0.04. The planetary companion has a mass of 2.090 $\pm$ 0.111 M J and a radius of 1.368 $\pm$ 0.090 R J yielding a mean density of 1.01 $\pm$ 0.18 g cm-3. HAT-P-23b is an inflated and massive hot Jupiter on a very short period orbit, and has one of the shortest characteristic infall times (7.5+2.9 - 1.8 Myr) before it gets engulfed by the star.  Based in part on observations obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated by the University of California and the California Institute of Technology. Keck time has been granted by NOAO and NASA.},

@article{Coughlin:2013,
	Abstract = {For much of human history we have wondered how our solar system formed, and whether there are any other planets like ours around other stars. Only in the last 20 years have we had direct evidence for the existence of exoplanets, with the number of known exoplanets dramatically increasing in recent years, especially with the success of the Kepler mission. Observations of these systems are becoming increasingly more precise and numerous, thus allowing for detailed studies of their masses, radii, densities, temperatures, and atmospheric compositions. However, one cannot accurately study exoplanets without examining their host stars in equal detail, and understanding what assumptions must be made to calculate planetary parameters from the directly derived observational parameters. In this thesis, I present observations and models of the primary transits and secondary eclipses of transiting exoplanets from both the ground and Kepler in order to better study their physical characteristics and search for additional exoplanets. I then identify, observe, and model new eclipsing binaries to better understand the stellar mass-radius relationship and stellar limb-darkening, compare these observations to the predictions of stellar models, and attempt to define to what extent these fundamental stellar characteristics can impact derived planetary parameters. I also present novel techniques for the direct determination of exoplanet masses and stellar inclinations via multi-wavelength astrometry, the ground-based photometric observation of stars at sub-millimagnitude precision, the reduction of Kepler photometry from pixel-level data, the extraction of radial velocities from spectroscopic observations, and the automatic identification, period analysis, and modeling of eclipsing binaries and transiting planets in large datasets.},

	Abstract = {We have executed a survey of nearby, main-sequence A-, F-, and G-type stars with the CHARA Array, successfully measuring the angular diameters of forty-four stars with an average precision of ~1.5%. We present new measures of the bolometric flux, which in turn leads to an empirical determination of the effective temperature for the stars observed. In addition, these CHARA-determined temperatures, radii, and luminosities are fit to Yonsei-Yale model isochrones to constrain the masses and ages of the stars. These results are compared to indirect estimates of these quantities obtained by collecting photometry of the stars and applying them to model atmospheres and evolutionary isochrones. We find that for most cases, the models overestimate the effective temperature by ~1.5%-4% when compared to our directly measured values. The overestimated temperatures and underestimated radii in these works appear to cause an additional offset in the star's surface gravity measurements, which consequently yield higher masses and younger ages, in particular for stars with masses greater than ~1.3 M &sun;. Additionally, we compare our measurements to a large sample of eclipsing binary stars, and excellent agreement is seen within both data sets. Finally, we present temperature relations with respect to (B - V) and (V - K) colors as well as spectral type, showing that calibration of effective temperatures with errors ~1% is now possible from interferometric angular diameters of stars.},

	Abstract = {Based on CHARA Array measurements, we present the angular diameters of 23 nearby, main-sequence stars, ranging from spectral types A7 to K0, 5 of which are exoplanet host stars. We derive linear radii, effective temperatures, and absolute luminosities of the stars using Hipparcos parallaxes and measured bolometric fluxes. The new data are combined with previously published values to create an Angular Diameter Anthology of measured angular diameters to main-sequence stars (luminosity classes V and IV). This compilation consists of 125 stars with diameter uncertainties of less than 5%, ranging in spectral types from A to M. The large quantity of empirical data is used to derive color-temperature relations to an assortment of color indices in the Johnson (BVR J I J JHK), Cousins (R C I C), Kron (R K I K), Sloan (griz), and WISE (W 3 W 4) photometric systems. These relations have an average standard deviation of ~3% and are valid for stars with spectral types A0-M4. To derive even more accurate relations for Sun-like stars, we also determined these temperature relations omitting early-type stars (T eff > 6750 K) that may have biased luminosity estimates because of rapid rotation; for this subset the dispersion is only ~2.5%. We find effective temperatures in agreement within a couple of percent for the interferometrically characterized sample of main-sequence stars compared to those derived via the infrared flux method and spectroscopic analysis.},

	Abstract = {Neutron stars in mass-transferring binaries are accreting the hydrogen and helium rich matter from the surfaces of their companions. This article simply explains the physics associated with how that material eventually fuses to form heavier nuclei and the observations of the time dependent phenomena (such as Type I X-ray bursts) associated with the thermally unstable thermonuclear reactions. We explain how the outcome depends on the composition of the accreting matter, the accretion rate and the mass, radius and thermal state of the neutron star. We also introduce many new analytic relations that are convenient for comparisons to both observations and computational results. After explaining nuclear burning for spherically symmetric accretion onto neutron stars, we discuss the possibility of asymmetric burning. In particular, we discuss some of the mysteries from EXOSAT observations of Type I X-Ray bursts and how the solution to these puzzles may lie in considering the lateral propagation of nuclear burning fronts around the star. Fully understanding this problem requires knowledge of parameters previously neglected such as the distribution of fresh fuel on the star, the magnetic field strength, and the stellar rotation. Recent RXTE observations of bursters may finally tell us some of these parameters.},

	Abstract = {Since the advent of powerful new X-ray observatories, NASA's Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), the Italian - Dutch BeppoSAX mission, XMM-Newton and Chandra, a number of entirely new phenomena associated with thermonuclear burning on neutron stars have been discovered. These include: (i) the discovery of millisecond (300 - 600 Hz) oscillations during bursts, so called ``burst oscillations'', (ii) a new regime of nuclear burning on neutron stars which manifests itself through the generation of hours long flares about once a decade, now referred to as ``superbursts'',(iii) discoveries of bursts from low accretion rate neutron stars, and (iv) new evidence for discrete spectral features from bursting neutron stars. In this article we review our current understanding of thermonuclear bursts on neutron stars, with a focus on these new phenomena.},

@article{Stahler:1988,
	Abstract = {A series of simplified evolutionary calculations are used to show that deuterium burning acts as an effective thermostat in low-mass protostars over a plausible range of initial conditions and mass accretion rates. The thermostat keeps the central temperature of the accreting hydrostatic core close to 10 to the 6th K, and thereby tightly constrains the core's mass-radius relation. This relation, when combined with premain-sequence evolutionary tracks, yields a theoretical birthline or upper envelope for young stars in the H-R diagram which maintains excellent agreement with observations of T Tauri stars in nearby molecular cloud complexes. This derivation of the birthline helps to explain its insensitivity to protostellar collapse conditions. The calculations indicate that the birthline will be little affected by the inclusion of rotation as long as the newly visible stars have lost most of their accreted angular momentum.},

	Abstract = {Rotation is a key parameter in the evolution of stars. From 1 Myr (the age of the ONC) to 4.5 Gyr (the age of the Sun), solar-like stars lose about 1-2 orders of specific angular momentum. The main agents for this rotational braking are believed to be star-disk interaction and magnetically powered stellar winds. Over the last decade, the observational fundament to probe the stellar spindown has dramatically improved. Significant progress has been made in exploring the underlying physical causes of the rotational braking. Parameterized models combining the effects of star-disk interaction, winds, and pre-main sequence contraction are able to reproduce the main features of the rotational data for stars spanning more than 3 orders of magnitude in age. This has allowed us to constrain stellar ages based on the rotation rates (`gyrochronology'). One main challenge for future work is to extend this type of analysis to the substellar mass range, where the rotational database is still sparse. More theoretical and observational work is required to explore the physics of the braking processes, aiming to explain rotational evolution from first principles. In this review for Cool Stars 15, I will summarize the status quo and the recent developments in the field.},

	Abstract = {Stellar physics and evolution calculations enable a broad range of research in astrophysics. Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open source, robust, efficient, thread-safe libraries for a wide range of applications in computational stellar astrophysics. A one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESAstar, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very low mass to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data, and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the extensive verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very old ages; the complete evolutionary track of a 1 M sun star from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star. MESA can be downloaded from the project Web site (http://mesa.sourceforge.net/).},

	Abstract = {Transit surveys combined with Doppler data have revealed a class of gas giant planets that are massive and highly enriched in heavy-elements (e.g., HD 149026b, GJ436b, and HAT-P-20b). It is tempting to consider these planets as validation of core accretion plus gas capture because it is often assumed that disk instability planets should be of nebular composition. We show in this paper, to the contrary, that gas giants that form by disk instability can have a variety of heavy-element compositions, ranging from sub- to super-nebular values. High levels of enrichment can be achieved through one or multiple mechanisms, including enrichment at birth, planetesimal capture, and differentiation plus tidal stripping. As a result, the metallicity of an individual gas giant cannot be used to discriminate between gas giant formation modes.},

@article{Mordasini:2012b,
	Abstract = {Context. The research of extrasolar planets has entered an era in which we characterize extrasolar planets. This has become possible with measurements of the radii of transiting planets and of the luminosity of planets observed by direct imaging. Meanwhile, the precision of radial velocity surveys makes it possible to discover not only giant planets but also very low-mass ones. 
Aims: Uniting all these different observational constraints into one coherent picture to better understand planet formation is an important and simultaneously difficult undertaking. One approach is to develop a theoretical model that can make testable predictions for all these observational techniques. Our goal is to have such a model and use it in population synthesis calculations. 
Methods: In a companion paper, we described how we have extended our formation model into a self-consistently coupled formation and evolution model. In this second paper, we first continue with the model description. We describe how we calculate the internal structure of the solid core of the planet and include radiogenic heating. We also introduce an upgrade of the protoplanetary disk model. Finally, we use the upgraded model in population synthesis calculations. 
Results: We present how the planetary mass-radius relationship of planets with primordial H2/He envelopes forms and evolves in time. The basic shape of the mass-radius relationship can be understood from the core accretion model. Low-mass planets cannot bind massive envelopes, while super-critical cores necessarily trigger runway gas accretion, leading to "forbidden" zones in the M - R plane. For a given mass, there is a considerable diversity of radii, mainly due to different bulk compositions, reflecting different formation histories. We compare the synthetic M - R plane with the observed one, finding good agreement for a > 0.1 AU. The synthetic planetary radius distribution is characterized by a strong increase towards small R and a second, lower local maximum at about 1 RJup. The increase towards small radii comes from the increase of the mass function towards low M. The second local maximum is due to the fact that radii are nearly independent of mass for giant planets. A comparison of the synthetic radius distribution with Kepler data shows good agreement for R geq 2 R⊕, but divergence for smaller radii. This indicates that for R geq 2 R⊕ the radius distribution can be described with planets with primordial H2/He atmospheres, while at smaller radii, planets of a different nature dominate. We predict that in the next few years, Kepler will find the second local maximum at about 1 RJup. 
Conclusions: With the updated model, we can compute the most important quantities, like mass, semimajor axis, radius, and luminosity, which characterize an extrasolar planet self-consistently from its formation. The comparison of the radii of the synthetic planets with observations makes it possible to better constrain this formation process and to distinguish between fundamental types of planets.},

	Abstract = {Context. A first characterization of extrasolar planets by the observational determination of the radius has recently been achieved for a large number of planets. For some planets, a measurement of the luminosity has also been possible, with many more directly imaged planets expected in the near future. The statistical characterization of exoplanets through their mass-radius and mass-luminosity diagram is becoming possible. This is for planet formation and evolution theory of similar importance as the mass-distance diagram.  Aims: Our aim is to extend our planet-formation model into a coupled formation and evolution model. We want to calculate from one single model in a self-consistent way all basic quantities describing a planet: its mass, semimajor axis, composition, radius, and luminosity. We then want to use this model for population synthesis calculations.  Methods: In this and a companion paper, we show how we solve the structure equations describing the gaseous envelope of a protoplanet during the early-formation phase, the gas runaway accretion phase, and the evolutionary phase at constant mass on Gyr timescales. We improve the model further with a new prescription for the disk-limited gas accretion rate, an internal structure model for the planetary core assuming a differentiated interior, and the inclusion of radioactive decay as an additional heat source in the core.  Results: We study the in situ formation and evolution of Jupiter, the mass-radius relationship of giant planets, the influence of the core mass on the radius, and the luminosity both in the "hot start" and the "cold start" scenario. Special emphasis is placed on the validation of the model by comparing it with other models of planet formation and evolution. We find that our results agree very well with those of more complex models, despite a number of simplifications we make in our calculations.  Conclusions: The upgraded model yields the most important physical quantities describing a planet from its beginning as a tiny seed embryo to a Gyr-old planet. This is the case for all planets in a synthetic planetary population. Therefore, we can now use self-consistently the observational constraints coming from all major observational techniques. This is important in a time where different techniques yield constraints on very diverse sub-populations of planets, and where it is difficult to put all these constraints together in one coherent picture. Our comprehensive formation and evolution model should be helpful in this situation for the understanding of exoplanets.},

These results indicate that a major He depletion has either not occurred in the outer layers of Jupiter or of Saturn, or that such a depletion's effect on the density profile has been masked by the presence of denser components. Considerable uncertainty characterizes Uranian models; the one presently preferred has substantial heavy-element enhancement at depth and little ice-rock separation.},

	Abstract = {We present a catalog of revised effective temperatures for stars observed in long-cadence mode in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). We use Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) griz filters tied to the fundamental temperature scale. Polynomials for griz color-temperature relations are presented, along with correction terms for surface gravity effects, metallicity, and statistical corrections for binary companions or blending. We compare our temperature scale to the published infrared flux method (IRFM) scale for VTJKs in both open clusters and the Kepler fields. We find good agreement overall, with some deviations between (J - Ks )-based temperatures from the IRFM and both SDSS filter and other diagnostic IRFM color-temperature relationships above 6000 K. For field dwarfs, we find a mean shift toward hotter temperatures relative to the KIC, of order 215 K, in the regime where the IRFM scale is well defined (4000 K to 6500 K). This change is of comparable magnitude in both color systems and in spectroscopy for stars with T eff below 6000 K. Systematic differences between temperature estimators appear for hotter stars, and we define corrections to put the SDSS temperatures on the IRFM scale for them. When the theoretical dependence on gravity is accounted for, we find a similar temperature scale offset between the fundamental and KIC scales for giants. We demonstrate that statistical corrections to color-based temperatures from binaries are significant. Typical errors, mostly from uncertainties in extinction, are of order 100 K. Implications for other applications of the KIC are discussed.},

	Abstract = {It is suggested that the distribution of orbital eccentricities for extrasolar planets is well described by the Beta distribution. Several properties of the Beta distribution make it a powerful tool for this purpose. For example, the Beta distribution can reproduce a diverse range of probability density functions (PDFs) using just two shape parameters (a and b). We argue that this makes it ideal for serving as a parametric model in Bayesian comparative population analysis. The Beta distribution is also uniquely defined over the interval zero to unity, meaning that it can serve as a proper prior for eccentricity when analysing the observations of bound extrasolar planets. Using nested sampling, we find that the distribution of eccentricities for 396 exoplanets detected through radial velocity with high signal-to-noise is well described by a Beta distribution with parameters a = 0.867-0.044+0.044 and b = 3.03-0.16+0.17. The Beta distribution is shown to be 3.7 times more likely to represent the underlying distribution of exoplanet eccentricities than the next best model: a Rayleigh + exponential distribution. The same data are also used in an example population comparison utilizing the Beta distribution, where we find that the short- and long-period planets are described by distinct Beta distributions at a confidence of 11.6sigma and display a signature consistent with the effects of tidal circularization.},

	Abstract = {Infrared lightcurves of transiting hot Jupiters present a trend in which the atmospheres of the hottest planets are less efficient at redistributing the stellar energy absorbed on their daysides---and thus have a larger day-night temperature contrast---than colder planets. No predictive atmospheric model has been published that identifies which dynamical mechanisms determine the atmospheric heat redistribution efficiency on tidally locked exoplanets. Here we present a two-layer shallow water model of the atmospheric dynamics on synchronously rotating planets that explains the observed trend. Our model shows that planets with weak friction and weak irradiation exhibit a banded zonal flow with minimal day-night temperature differences, while models with strong irradiation and/or strong friction exhibit a day-night flow pattern with order-unity fractional day-night temperature differences. To interpret the model, we develop a scaling theory that shows that the timescale for gravity waves to propagate horizontally over planetary scales, t_wave, plays a dominant role in controlling the transition from small to large temperature contrasts. This implies that heat redistribution is governed by a wave-like process, similar to the one responsible for the weak temperature gradients in the Earth's tropics. When atmospheric drag can be neglected, the transition from small to large day-night temperature contrasts occurs when t_wave ~ sqrt(t_rad/Omega), where t_rad is the radiative relaxation time, and Omega is the planetary rotation frequency. Alternatively, this transition criterion can be expressed as t_rad ~ t_vert, where t_vert is the timescale for a fluid parcel to move vertically over the difference in day-night thickness. These results subsume the commonly used timescale comparison for estimating heat redistribution efficiency between t_rad and the global horizontal advection timescale, t_adv.},

	Abstract = {We present a new, magnetohydrodynamic mechanism for inflation of close-in giant extrasolar planets. The idea behind the mechanism is that current, which is induced through interaction of atmospheric winds and the planetary magnetic field, results in significant Ohmic dissipation of energy in the interior. We develop an analytical model for computation of interior Ohmic dissipation, with a simplified treatment of the atmosphere. We apply our model to HD209458b, Tres-4b, and HD189733b. With conservative assumptions for wind speed and field strength, our model predicts a generated power that appears to be large enough to maintain the transit radii, opening an unexplored avenue toward solving a decade-old puzzle of extrasolar gas giant radius anomalies.},

	Abstract = {We use the optical and near-infrared photometry from the Kepler Input Catalog to provide improved estimates of the stellar characteristics of the smallest stars in the Kepler target list. We find 3897 dwarfs with temperatures below 4000 K, including 64 planet candidate host stars orbited by 95 transiting planet candidates. We refit the transit events in the Kepler light curves for these planet candidates and combine the revised planet/star radius ratios with our improved stellar radii to revise the radii of the planet candidates orbiting the cool target stars. We then compare the number of observed planet candidates to the number of stars around which such planets could have been detected in order to estimate the planet occurrence rate around cool stars. We find that the occurrence rate of 0.5-4 R ⊕ planets with orbital periods shorter than 50 days is 0.90^{+0.04}_{-0.03} planets per star. The occurrence rate of Earth-size (0.5-1.4 R ⊕) planets is constant across the temperature range of our sample at 0.51_{-0.05}^{+0.06} Earth-size planets per star, but the occurrence of 1.4-4 R ⊕ planets decreases significantly at cooler temperatures. Our sample includes two Earth-size planet candidates in the habitable zone, allowing us to estimate that the mean number of Earth-size planets in the habitable zone is 0.15^{+0.13}_{-0.06} planets per cool star. Our 95% confidence lower limit on the occurrence rate of Earth-size planets in the habitable zones of cool stars is 0.04 planets per star. With 95% confidence, the nearest transiting Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of a cool star is within 21 pc. Moreover, the nearest non-transiting planet in the habitable zone is within 5 pc with 95% confidence.},

	Abstract = {In the outer regions of the habitable zone, the risk of transitioning into a globally frozen "snowball" state poses a threat to the habitability of planets with the capacity to host water-based life. Here, we use a one-dimensional energy balance climate model (EBM) to examine how obliquity, spin rate, orbital eccentricity, and the fraction of the surface covered by ocean might influence the onset of such a snowball state. For an exoplanet, these parameters may be strikingly different from the values observed for Earth. Since, for a constant semimajor axis, the annual mean stellar irradiation scales with (1 - e 2)-1/2, one might expect the greatest habitable semimajor axis (for fixed atmospheric composition) to scale as (1 - e 2)-1/4. We find that this standard simple ansatz provides a reasonable lower bound on the outer boundary of the habitable zone, but the influence of both obliquity and ocean fraction can be profound in the context of planets on eccentric orbits. For planets with eccentricity 0.5, for instance, our EBM suggests that the greatest habitable semimajor axis can vary by more than 0.8 AU (78%!) depending on obliquity, with higher obliquity worlds generally more stable against snowball transitions. One might also expect that the long winter at an eccentric planet's apoastron would render it more susceptible to global freezing. Our models suggest that this is not a significant risk for Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars, as considered here, since such planets are buffered by the thermal inertia provided by oceans covering at least 10% of their surface. Since planets on eccentric orbits spend much of their year particularly far from the star, such worlds might turnout to be especially good targets for direct observations with missions such as TPF-Darwin. Nevertheless, the extreme temperature variations achieved on highly eccentric exo-Earths raise questions about the adaptability of life to marginally or transiently habitable conditions.},

@article{Charbonneau:2009,
	Abstract = {A decade ago, the detection of the first transiting extrasolar planet provided a direct constraint on its composition and opened the door to spectroscopic investigations of extrasolar planetary atmospheres. Because such characterization studies are feasible only for transiting systems that are both nearby and for which the planet-to-star radius ratio is relatively large, nearby small stars have been surveyed intensively. Doppler studies and microlensing have uncovered a population of planets with minimum masses of 1.9-10 times the Earth's mass (M⊕), called super-Earths. The first constraint on the bulk composition of this novel class of planets was afforded by CoRoT-7b (refs 8, 9), but the distance and size of its star preclude atmospheric studies in the foreseeable future. Here we report observations of the transiting planet GJ1214b, which has a mass of 6.55M⊕ and a radius 2.68 times Earth's radius (R⊕), indicating that it is intermediate in stature between Earth and the ice giants of the Solar System. We find that the planetary mass and radius are consistent with a composition of primarily water enshrouded by a hydrogen-helium envelope that is only 0.05% of the mass of the planet. The atmosphere is probably escaping hydrodynamically, indicating that it has undergone significant evolution during its history. The star is small and only 13parsecs away, so the planetary atmosphere is amenable to study with current observatories.},

	Abstract = {We present Spitzer Space Telescope time series photometry of the exoplanet system HD 189733 spanning two times of secondary eclipse, when the planet passes out of view behind the parent star. We estimate the relative eclipse depth in five distinct bands and find the planet-to-star flux ratio to be 0.256%+/-0.014% (3.6 mum), 0.214%+/-0.020% (4.5 mum), 0.310%+/-0.034% (5.8 mum), 0.391%+/-0.022% (8.0 mum), and 0.598%+/-0.038% (24 mum). For consistency, we reanalyze a previously published time series to deduce a contrast ratio in an additional band, 0.519%+/-0.020% (16 mum). Our data are strongly inconsistent with a Planck spectrum, and we clearly detect emission near 4 mum as predicted by published theoretical models in which this feature arises from a corresponding opacity window. Unlike recent results for the exoplanet HD 209458b, we find that the emergent spectrum from HD 189733b is best matched by models that do not include an atmospheric temperature inversion. Taken together, these two studies provide initial observational support for the idea that hot Jupiter atmospheres diverge into two classes, in which a thermal inversion layer is present for the more strongly irradiated objects.},

	Abstract = {We present precise z-band photometric time series spanning times of transit of the two exoplanets recently discovered by the SuperWASP collaboration. We find planetary radii of 1.44+/-0.08 and 1.04+/-0.06 RJ for WASP-1b and WASP-2b, respectively. These error estimates include both random errors in the photometry and also the uncertainty in the stellar masses. Our results are 5 times more precise than the values derived from the discovery data alone. Our measurement of the radius of WASP-2b agrees with previously published models of hot Jupiters that include both a 20 M⊕ core of solid material and the effects of stellar insolation. In contrast, we find that the models cannot account for the large size of WASP-1b, even if the planet has no core. Thus, we add WASP-1b to the growing list of hot Jupiters that are larger than expected. This suggests that ``inflated'' hot Jupiters are more common than previously thought and that any purported explanations involving highly unusual circumstances are disfavored.},

	Abstract = {We report g, V, and r photometric time series of HD 149026 spanning predicted times of transit of the Saturn-mass planetary companion, which was recently discovered by Sato and collaborators. We present a joint analysis of our observations and the previously reported photometry and radial velocities of the central star. We refine the estimate of the transit ephemeris to Tc=(2,453,527.87455+0.00085-0.00091)+(2.87598+0.00012-0.00017)N (HJD). Assuming that the star has a radius of 1.45+/-0.10 Rsolar and a mass of 1.30+/-0.10 Msolar, we estimate the planet radius to be (0.726+/-0.064)RJup, which implies a mean density of 1.07+0.42-0.30 g cm-3. This density is significantly greater than predicted for models that include the effects of stellar insolation and in which the planet has only a small core of solid material. Thus, we confirm that this planet likely contains a large core and that the ratio of core mass to total planet mass is more akin to that of Uranus and Neptune than to either Jupiter or Saturn.},

	Abstract = {We present Spitzer Space Telescope infrared photometric time series of the transiting extrasolar planet system TrES-1. The data span a predicted time of secondary eclipse, corresponding to the passage of the planet behind the star. In both bands of our observations, we detect a flux decrement with a timing, amplitude, and duration as predicted by published parameters of the system. This signal represents the first direct detection of (i.e., the observation of photons emitted by) a planet orbiting another star. The observed eclipse depths (in units of relative flux) are 0.00066+/-0.00013 at 4.5 mum and 0.00225+/-0.00036 at 8.0 mum. These estimates provide the first observational constraints on models of the thermal emission of hot Jupiters. Assuming that the planet emits as a blackbody, we estimate an effective temperature of Tp=1060+/-50 K. Under the additional assumptions that the planet is in thermal equilibrium with the radiation from the star and emits isotropically, we find a Bond albedo of A=0.31+/-0.14. This would imply that the planet absorbs the majority of stellar radiation incident upon it, a conclusion of significant impact to atmospheric models of these objects. We also compare our data to a previously published model of the planetary thermal emission, which predicts prominent spectral features in our observational bands due to water and carbon monoxide. This model adequately reproduces the observed planet-to-star flux ratio at 8.0 mum however, it significantly overpredicts the ratio at 4.5 mum. We also present an estimate of the timing of the secondary eclipse, which we use to place a strong constraint on the expression ecosomega, where e is the orbital eccentricity and omega is the longitude of periastron. The resulting upper limit on e is sufficiently small that we conclude that tidal dissipation is unlikely to provide a significant source of energy interior to the planet.},

	Abstract = {We report high-precision spectrophotometric observations of four planetary transits of HD 209458, in the region of the sodium resonance doublet at 589.3 nm. We find that the photometric dimming during transit in a bandpass centered on the sodium feature is deeper by (2.32+/-0.57)×10-4 relative to simultaneous observations of the transit in adjacent bands. We interpret this additional dimming as absorption from sodium in the planetary atmosphere, as recently predicted from several theoretical modeling efforts. Our model for a cloudless planetary atmosphere with a solar abundance of sodium in atomic form predicts more sodium absorption than we observe. There are several possibilities that may account for this reduced amplitude, including reaction of atomic sodium into molecular gases and/or condensates, photoionization of sodium by the stellar flux, a low primordial abundance of sodium, and the presence of clouds high in the atmosphere. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope (HST), obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	Abstract = {We report high-precision, high-cadence photometric measurements of the star HD 209458, which is known from radial velocity measurements to have a planetary-mass companion in a close orbit. We detect two separate transit events at times that are consistent with the radial velocity measurements. In both cases, the detailed shape of the transit curve due to both the limb darkening of the star and the finite size of the planet is clearly evident. Assuming stellar parameters of 1.1 Rsolar and 1.1 Msolar, we find that the data are best interpreted as a gas giant with a radius of 1.27+/-0.02 RJup in an orbit with an inclination of 87.1d+/-0.2d. We present values for the planetary surface gravity, escape velocity, and average density and discuss the numerous observations that are warranted now that a planet is known to transit the disk of its parent star.},

	Abstract = {We examine the consequences of tidal interaction between eccentric short-period extrasolar planets and their host stars and of secular perturbations between planets in a given system. If the planet is within 0.05 AU of the star, the dissipation of the stellar tidal disturbance within the planet provides a significant energy source, which causes the planet to inflate as it adjusts to a thermal equilibrium. We determine the planetary size as a function of the tidal dissipation rate with or without the presence of a core. Inflation intensifies the star-planet tidal interaction and accelerates the pace of the planet's spin synchronization and orbital circularization. We apply our results to three systems with short-period planets: HD 209458, Ups And, and Tau Boo. University of California Observatories, Lick Observatory Bulletin, No. 139P.},

	Abstract = {Kepler photometry has revealed two unusual transiting companions: one orbiting an early A-star and the other orbiting a late B-star. In both cases, the occultation of the companion is deeper than the transit. The occultation and transit with follow-up optical spectroscopy reveal a 9400 K early A-star, KOI-74 (KIC 6889235), with a companion in a 5.2 day orbit with a radius of 0.08 R sun and a 10,000 K late B-star KOI-81 (KIC 8823868) that has a companion in a 24 day orbit with a radius of 0.2 R sun. We infer a temperature of 12,250 K for KOI-74b and 13,500 K for KOI-81b. We present 43 days of high duty cycle, 30 minute cadence photometry, with models demonstrating the intriguing properties of these objects, and speculate on their nature.},

Assuming Pluto to be 100% methane, available methane density data can be used to set a lower limit of 0.53 g/cu cm on Pluto's density, thus placing an absolute upper limit of 1909 km on the radius and a lower limit of 0.32 on the albedo. The results of 280 computer models covering a wide range of composition ratios of rock, water ice, and methane ice are reported. Limits are placed on Pluto's silicate content, and a simple spacecraft method for determining Pluto's water content from its density and moment of inertia is given. The low thermal conductivity and strength of solid methane suggest rapid solid-state convection in Pluto's methane layer.},

	Abstract = {Using a self-consistent atmosphere code, we construct a new model of the atmosphere of the transiting extrasolar giant planet HD 209458b to investigate the disparity between the observed strength of the sodium absorption feature at 589 nm and the predictions of previous models. For the atmospheric temperature-pressure profile we derive, silicate and iron clouds reside at a pressure of several millibars in the planet's atmosphere. These clouds have significant vertical extent and optical depth because of our slant viewing geometry and lead to increased absorption in bands directly adjacent to the sodium line core. Using a non-LTE sodium ionization model that includes photoionization by stellar UV flux, collisional processes with H2, and radiative recombination, we show that the ionization depth in the planet's atmosphere reaches ~1/2 mbar at the day/night terminator. Ionization leads to a slight weakening of the sodium feature. We present our baseline model, including ionization and clouds, which falls near the observational error bars. The sensitivity of our conclusions to the derived atmospheric temperature-pressure profile is discussed.},

	Abstract = {We present the first models of Jupiter and Saturn to couple their evolution to both a radiative-atmosphere grid and to high-pressure phase diagrams of hydrogen with helium and other admixtures. We find that prior calculated phase diagrams in which Saturn's interior reaches a region of predicted helium immiscibility do not allow enough energy release to prolong Saturn's cooling to its known age and effective temperature. We explore modifications to published phase diagrams that would lead to greater energy release, and propose a modified H-He phase diagram that is physically reasonable, leads to the correct extension of Saturn's cooling, and predicts an atmospheric helium mass fraction Yatmos=0.185, in agreement with recent estimates. We also explore the possibility of internal separation of elements heavier than helium, and find that, alternatively, such separation could prolong Saturn's cooling to its known age and effective temperature under a realistic phase diagram and heavy element abundance (in which case Saturn's Yatmos would be solar but heavier elements would be depleted). In none of these scenarios does Jupiter's interior evolve to any region of helium or heavy-element immiscibility: Jupiter evolves homogeneously to the present day. We discuss the implications of our calculations for Saturn's primordial core mass.},

	Abstract = {We build on recent new evolutionary models of Jupiter and Saturn and here extend our calculations to investigate the evolution of extrasolar giant planets of mass 0.15MJ-3.0MJ. Our inhomogeneous thermal history models show that the possible phase separation of helium from liquid metallic hydrogen in the deep interiors of these planets can lead to luminosities ~2 times greater than have been predicted by homogeneous models. For our chosen phase diagram this phase separation will begin to affect the planets' evolution at ~700 Myr for a 0.15MJ object and ~10 Gyr for a 3.0MJ object. We show how phase separation affects the luminosity, effective temperature, radii, and atmospheric helium mass fraction as a function of age for planets of various masses, with and without heavy element cores, and with and without the effect of modest stellar irradiation. This phase separation process will likely not affect giant planets within a few AU of their parent star, as these planets cool to their equilibrium temperatures, determined by stellar heating, before the onset of phase separation. We discuss the detectability of these objects and the likelihood that the energy provided by helium phase separation can change the timescales for formation and settling of ammonia clouds by several gigayears. We discuss how correctly incorporating stellar irradiation into giant planet atmosphere and albedo modeling may lead to a consistent evolutionary history for Jupiter and Saturn.},

	Abstract = {We present new self-consistent atmosphere models for the transiting planets TrES-1 and HD 209458b. The planets were recently observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope in bands centered on 4.5 and 8.0 mum, for TrES-1, and 24 mum, for HD 209458b. We find that standard solar-metallicity models fit the observations for HD 209458b. For TrES-1, which has a Teff ~300 K cooler, we find that models with a metallicity 3-5 times enhanced over solar abundances can match the 1 sigma error bar at 4.5 mum and 2 sigma at 8.0 mum. Models with solar abundances that include energy deposition into the stratosphere give fluxes that fall within the 2 sigma error bars in both bands. The best-fit models for both planets assume that reradiation of absorbed stellar flux occurs over the entire planet. For all models of both planets, we predict planet-to-star flux ratios in other Spitzer bandpasses.},

	Abstract = {Here we show preliminary calculations of the cooling and contraction of a 2 M{J} planet. These calculations, which are being extended to 1-10 M{J}, differ from other published ``cooling tracks'' in that they include a core accretion-gas capture formation scenario, the leading theory for the formation of gas giant planets. We find that the initial post-accretionary intrinsic luminosity of the planet is ˜3 times less than previously published models which use arbitrary initial conditions. These differences last a few tens of millions of years. Young giant planets are intrinsically fainter than has been previously appreciated. We also discuss how uncertainties in atmospheric chemistry and the duration of the formation time of giant planets lead to challenges in deriving planetary physical properties from comparison with tabulated model values.},

	Abstract = {Through a simple physical argument we show that the slant optical depth through the atmosphere of a `hot Jupiter' planet is ~35-90 times greater than the normal optical depth. This not unexpected result has direct consequences for the method of transmission spectroscopy for characterizing the atmospheres of transiting giant planets. The atmospheres of these planets likely contain minor condensates and hazes, which at normal viewing geometry have negligible optical depth, but at slant viewing geometry have appreciable optical depth that can obscure absorption features of gaseous atmospheric species. We identify several possible condensates. We predict that this is a general masking mechanism for all planets, not just for HD 209458b, and will lead to weaker than expected or undetected absorption features. Constraints on an atmosphere from transmission spectroscopy are not the same as constraints on an atmosphere at normal viewing geometry.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the atmosphere and interior of the new transiting planet HD 149026b, which appears to be very rich in heavy elements. We first compute model atmospheres at metallicities ranging from solar to 10 times solar and show how for cases with high metallicity or inefficient redistribution of energy from the dayside, the planet may develop a hot stratosphere due to absorption of stellar flux by TiO and VO. The spectra predicted by these models are very different than cooler atmosphere models without stratospheres. The spectral effects are potentially detectable with the Spitzer Space Telescope. In addition, the models with hot stratospheres lead to a large limb brightening, rather than darkening. We compare the atmosphere of HD 149026b to other well-known transiting planets, including the recently discovered HD 189733b, which we show has a planet-to-star flux ratio twice that of HD 209458 and TrES-1. The methane abundance in the atmosphere of HD 189733b is a sensitive indicator of atmospheric temperature and metallicity and can be constrained with Spitzer IRAC observations. We then turn to interior studies of HD 149026b and use a grid of self-consistent model atmospheres and high-pressure equations of state for all components to compute thermal evolution models of the planet. We estimate that the mass of heavy elements within the planet is in the range of 60-93 M⊕. Finally, we discuss trends in the radii of transiting planets with metallicity in light of this new member of the class.},

	Abstract = {We explore the infrared spectrum of a three-dimensional dynamical model of planet HD 209458b as a function of orbital phase. The dynamical model predicts dayside atmospheric pressure-temperature profiles that are much more isothermal at pressures less than 1 bar than one-dimensional radiative-convective models have found. The resulting dayside thermal spectra are very similar to a blackbody, and only weak water absorption features are seen at short wavelengths. The dayside emission is consequently in better agreement with ground-based and space-based secondary eclipse data than any previous models, which predict strong flux peaks and deep absorption features. At other orbital phases, absorption due to carbon monoxide and methane is also predicted. We compute the spectra under two treatments of atmospheric chemistry: one uses the predictions of equilibrium chemistry, and the other uses nonequilibrium chemistry, which ties the timescales of methane and carbon monoxide chemistry to dynamical timescales. As a function of orbital phase, we predict planet-to-star flux ratios for standard infrared bands and all Spitzer Space Telescope bands. In Spitzer bands, we predict two- to fifteenfold variation in planetary flux as a function of orbital phase with equilibrium chemistry, and two- to fourfold variation with nonequilibrium chemistry. Variation is generally more pronounced in bands from 3 to 10 mum than at longer wavelengths. The orbital phase of maximum thermal emission in infrared bands is 15-45 orbital degrees before the time of secondary eclipse. Changes in flux as a function of orbital phase for HD 209458b should be observable with Spitzer, given the previously achieved observational error bars.},

@article{Fortney:2007,
	Abstract = {To aid in the physical interpretation of planetary radii constrained through observations of transiting planets, or eventually direct detections, we compute model radii of pure hydrogen-helium, water, rock, and iron planets, along with various mixtures. Masses ranging from 0.01 Earth masses to 10 Jupiter masses at orbital distances of 0.02-10 AU are considered. For hydrogen-helium rich planets, our models are the first to couple planetary evolution to stellar irradiation over a wide range of orbital separations (0.02-10 AU) through a nongray radiative-convective equilibrium atmosphere model. Stellar irradiation retards the contraction of giant planets, but its effect is not a simple function of the irradiation level: a planet at 1 AU contracts as slowly as a planet at 0.1 AU. We confirm the assertion of Guillot that very old giant planets under modest stellar irradiation (like that received by Jupiter and Saturn) develop isothermal atmospheric radiative zones once the planet's intrinsic flux drops to a small fraction of the incident flux. For hydrogen-helium planets, we consider cores up to 90% of the total planet mass, comparable to those of Uranus and Neptune. If ``hot Neptunes'' have maintained their original masses and are not remnants of more massive planets, radii of ~0.30-0.45 RJ are expected. Water planets are ~40%-50% larger than rocky planets, independent of mass. Finally, we provide tables of planetary radii at various ages and compositions, and for ice-rock-iron planets we fit our results to analytic functions, which will allow for quick composition estimates, given masses and radii, or mass estimates, given only planetary radii. These results will assist in the interpretation of observations for both the current transiting planet surveys as well as upcoming space missions, including COROT and Kepler.},

We present model atmospheres of several of these planets and compare our computed infrared spectra to recent space-based and ground-based infrared observations. One-dimensional radiative-equilibrium models yield infrared planet-to-star flux ratios that are in general a good match with the Spitzer data published to date. We also explore spectra as a function of orbital phase for a three-dimensional dynamical atmosphere model of planet HD 209458b. The day-side temperature structure and spectra of the dynamical model is quite different than other models. Observed flux as a function of orbital phase should be very sensitive to departures from equilibrium CO/CH_4 chemistry.},

	Abstract = {Published mid-infrared spectra of transiting planets HD 209458b and HD 189733b, obtained during secondary eclipse by the InfraRed Spectrograph (IRS) aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope, are predominantly featureless. In particular, these flux ratio spectra do not exhibit an expected feature arising from water vapor absorption shortward of 10 mum. Here we suggest that in the absence of flux variability, the spectral data for HD 189733b are inconsistent with 8 mum photometry obtained with Spitzer's InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC), perhaps an indication of problems with the challenging reduction of the IRS spectra. The IRAC point, along with previously published secondary eclipse photometry for HD 189733b, are in good agreement with a one-dimensional model of HD 189733b that clearly shows absorption due to water vapor in the emergent spectrum. We are not able to draw firm conclusions regarding the IRS data for HD 209458b, but spectra predicted by 1D and 3D atmosphere models fit the data adequately, without adjustment of the water abundance or reliance on cloud opacity. We argue that the generally good agreement between model spectra and IRS spectra of brown dwarfs with atmospheric temperatures similar to these highly irradiated planets lends confidence in the modeling procedure.},

	Abstract = {We examine the spectra and infrared colors of the cool, methane-dominated atmospheres at Teff<=1400 K expected for young gas giant planets. We couple these spectral calculations to an updated version of the Marley et al. giant planet thermal evolution models that include formation by core accretion-gas capture. These relatively cool ``young Jupiters'' can be 1-6 mag fainter than predicted by standard cooling tracks that include a traditional initial condition, which may provide a diagnostic of formation. If correct, this would make true Jupiter-like planets much more difficult to detect at young ages than previously thought. Since Jupiter and Saturn are of distinctly supersolar composition, we examine emitted spectra for model planets at both solar metallicity and a metallicity of 5 times solar. These metal-enhanced young Jupiters have lower pressure photospheres than field brown dwarfs of the same effective temperatures arising from both lower surface gravities and enhanced atmospheric opacity. We highlight several diagnostics for enhanced metallicity. A stronger CO absorption band at 4.5 mum for the warmest objects is predicted. At all temperatures, enhanced flux in K band is expected due to reduced collisional induced absorption by H2. This leads to correspondingly redder near-infrared colors, which are redder than solar metallicity models with the same surface gravity by up to 0.7 in J-K and 1.5 in H-K. Molecular absorption band depths increase as well, most significantly for the coolest objects. We also qualitatively assess the changes to emitted spectra due to nonequilibrium chemistry.},

@article{Fortney:2008,
	Abstract = {We highlight the importance of gaseous TiO and VO opacity on the highly irradiated close-in giant planets. The day-side atmospheres of these planets naturally fall into two classes that are somewhat analogous to the M- and L-type dwarfs. Those that are warm enough to have appreciable opacity due to TiO and VO gases we term ``pM class'' planets, and those that are cooler we term ``pL class'' planets. We calculate model atmospheres for these planets, including pressure-temperature profiles, spectra, and characteristic radiative time constants. We show that pM class planets have temperature inversions (hot stratospheres), appear ``anomalously'' bright in the mid-infrared secondary eclipse, and feature molecular bands in emission rather than absorption. From simple physical arguments, we show that they will have large day/night temperature contrasts and negligible phase shifts between orbital phase and thermal emission light curves, because radiative timescales are much shorter than possible dynamical timescales. The pL class planets absorb incident flux deeper in the atmosphere where atmospheric dynamics will more readily redistribute absorbed energy. This will lead to cooler day sides, warmer night sides, and larger phase shifts in thermal emission light curves. The boundary between these classes (~0.04-0.05 AU from a Sun-like primary for solar composition) is particularly dependent on the incident flux from the parent star, and less so on other factors. We apply these results to several planets and note that the eccentric transiting planets HD 147506b and HD 17156b alternate between the classes. Thermal emission in the optical from pM class planets is significant redward of 400 nm, making these planets attractive targets for optical detection. The difference in the observed day/night contrast between upsilo And b (pM class) and HD 189733b (pL class) is naturally explained in this scenario.},

	Abstract = {We compute models of the transmission spectra of planets HD 209458b, HD 189733b, and generic hot Jupiters. We examine the effects of temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity for the generic planets as a guide to understanding transmission spectra in general. We find that carbon dioxide absorption at 4.4 and 15 mum is prominent at high metallicity, and is a clear metallicity indicator. For HD 209458b and HD 189733b, we compute spectra for both one-dimensional and three-dimensional model atmospheres and examine the differences between them. The differences are usually small, but can be large if atmospheric temperatures are near important chemical abundance boundaries. The calculations for the three-dimensional atmospheres, and their comparison with data, serve as constraints on these dynamical models that complement the secondary eclipse and light curve data sets. For HD 209458b, even if TiO and VO gases are abundant on the dayside, their abundances can be considerably reduced on the cooler planetary limb. However, given the predicted limb temperatures and TiO abundances, the model's optical opacity is too high. For HD 189733b we find a good match with some infrared data sets and constrain the altitude of a postulated haze layer. For this planet, substantial differences can exist between the transmission spectra of the leading and trailing hemispheres, which are an excellent probe of carbon chemistry. In thermochemical equilibrium, the cooler leading hemisphere is methane-dominated, and the hotter trailing hemisphere is CO-dominated, but these differences may be eliminated by non-equilibrium chemistry due to vertical mixing. It may be possible to constrain the carbon chemistry of this planet, and its spatial variation, with James Webb Space Telescope.},

	Abstract = {The determination of Saturn's atmospheric noble gas abundances are critical to understanding the formation and evolution of Saturn, and giant planets in general. These measurements can only be performed with an entry probe. A Saturn probe will address whether enhancement in heavy noble gases, as was found in Jupiter, are a general feature of giant planets, and their ratios will be a powerful constraint on how they form. The helium abundance will show the extent to which helium has phase separated from hydrogen in the planet's deep interior. Jupiter's striking neon depletion may also be tied to its helium depletion, and must be confirmed or refuted in Saturn. Together with Jupiter's measured atmospheric helium abundance, a consistent evolutionary theory for both planets, including "helium rain" will be possible. We will then be able to calibrate the theory of the evolution of all giant planets, including exoplanets. In addition, high pressure H/He mixtures under giant planet conditions are an important area of condensed matter physics that are beyond the realm of experiment.},

	Abstract = {We discuss our current understanding of the interior structure and thermal evolution of giant planets. This includes the gas giants, such as Jupiter and Saturn, that are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, as well as the ``ice giants,'' such as Uranus and Neptune, which are primarily composed of elements heavier than H/He. The effect of different hydrogen equations of state (including new first-principles computations) on Jupiter's core mass and heavy element distribution is detailed. This variety of the hydrogen equations of state translate into an uncertainty in Jupiter's core mass of 18 M  ⊕ . For Uranus and Neptune we find deep envelope metallicities up to 0.95, perhaps indicating the existence of an eroded core, as also supported by their low luminosity. We discuss the results of simple cooling models of our solar system's planets, and show that more complex thermal evolution models may be necessary to understand their cooling history. We review how measurements of the masses and radii of the nearly 50 transiting extrasolar giant planets are changing our understanding of giant planets. In particular a fraction of these planets appear to be larger than can be accommodated by standard models of planetary contraction. We review the proposed explanations for the radii of these planets. We also discuss very young giant planets, which are being directly imaged with ground- and space-based telescopes.},

Here we define giant planets as those that have an observable hydrogen-helium envelope that includes Jupiter-like planets, which are predominantly H/He gas, and Neptune-like planets, which are predominantly composed of elements heavier than H/He. We describe the equations of state of planetary materials and the construction of static structural models and thermal evolution models. We apply these models to transiting planets close to their parent stars, as well as directly imaged planets far from their parent stars. Mechanisms that have been postulated to inflate the radii of close-in transiting planets are discussed. We also review knowledge gained from the study of the solar system's giant planets. The frontiers of giant planet physics are discussed with an eye toward future planetary discoveries.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of planet Kepler-12b (KOI-20), which at 1.695 $\pm$ 0.030 R J is among the handful of planets with super-inflated radii above 1.65 R J. Orbiting its slightly evolved G0 host with a 4.438 day period, this 0.431 $\pm$ 0.041 M J planet is the least irradiated within this largest-planet-radius group, which has important implications for planetary physics. The planet's inflated radius and low mass lead to a very low density of 0.111 $\pm$ 0.010 g cm-3. We detect the occultation of the planet at a significance of 3.7sigma in the Kepler bandpass. This yields a geometric albedo of 0.14 $\pm$ 0.04; the planetary flux is due to a combination of scattered light and emitted thermal flux. We use multiple observations with Warm Spitzer to detect the occultation at 7sigma and 4sigma in the 3.6 and 4.5 mum bandpasses, respectively. The occultation photometry timing is consistent with a circular orbit at e < 0.01 (1sigma) and e < 0.09 (3sigma). The occultation detections across the three bands favor an atmospheric model with no dayside temperature inversion. The Kepler occultation detection provides significant leverage, but conclusions regarding temperature structure are preliminary, given our ignorance of opacity sources at optical wavelengths in hot Jupiter atmospheres. If Kepler-12b and HD 209458b, which intercept similar incident stellar fluxes, have the same heavy-element masses, the interior energy source needed to explain the large radius of Kepler-12b is three times larger than that of HD 209458b. This may suggest that more than one radius-inflation mechanism is at work for Kepler-12b or that it is less heavy-element rich than other transiting planets.},

	Abstract = {We compute grids of radiative-convective model atmospheres for Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune over a range of intrinsic fluxes and surface gravities. The atmosphere grids serve as an upper boundary condition for models of the thermal evolution of the planets. Unlike previous work, we customize these grids for the specific properties of each planet, including the appropriate chemical abundances and incident fluxes as a function of solar system age. Using these grids, we compute new models of the thermal evolution of the major planets in an attempt to match their measured luminosities at their known ages. Compared to previous work, we find longer cooling times, predominantly due to higher atmospheric opacity at young ages. For all planets, we employ simple "standard" cooling models that feature adiabatic temperature gradients in the interior H/He and water layers, and an initially hot starting point for the calculation of subsequent cooling. For Jupiter, we find a model cooling age ~10% longer than previous work, a modest quantitative difference. This may indicate that the hydrogen equation of state used here overestimates the temperatures in the deep interior of the planet. For Saturn, we find a model cooling age ~20% longer than previous work. However, an additional energy source, such as that due to helium phase separation, is still clearly needed. For Neptune, unlike in work from the 1980s and 1990s, we match the measured T eff of the planet with a model that also matches the planet's current gravity field constraints. This is predominantly due to advances in the high-pressure equation of state of water. This may indicate that the planet possesses no barriers to efficient convection in its deep interior. However, for Uranus, our models exacerbate the well-known problem that Uranus is far cooler than calculations predict, which could imply strong barriers to interior convective cooling. The atmosphere grids are published here as tables, so that they may be used by the wider community.},

@article{Fortney:2012,
	Abstract = {Recent high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of nearby FGK stars suggests that a high C/O ratio of greater than 0.8, or even 1.0, is relatively common. Two published catalogs find C/O > 0.8 in 25%-30% of systems, and C/O > 1.0 in ~6%-10%. It has been suggested that in protoplanetary disks with C/O > 0.8 that the condensation pathways to refractory solids will differ from what occurred in our solar system, where C/O = 0.55. The carbon-rich disks are calculated to make carbon-dominated rocky planets, rather than oxygen-dominated ones. Here we suggest that the derived stellar C/O ratios are overestimated. One constraint on the frequency of high C/O is the relative paucity of carbon dwarf stars (10-3-10-5) found in large samples of low-mass stars. We suggest reasons for this overestimation, including a high C/O ratio for the solar atmosphere model used for differential abundance analysis, the treatment of a Ni blend that affects the O abundance, and limitations of one-dimensional LTE stellar atmosphere models. Furthermore, from the estimated errors on the measured stellar C/O ratios, we find that the significance of the high C/O tail is weakened, with a true measured fraction of C/O > 0.8 in 10%-15% of stars, and C/O > 1.0 in 1%-5%, although these are still likely overestimates. We suggest that infrared T-dwarf spectra could show how common high C/O is in the stellar neighborhood, as the chemistry and spectra of such objects would differ compared to those with solar-like abundances. While possible at C/O > 0.8, we expect that carbon-dominated rocky planets are rarer than others have suggested.},

I first focus on the two lightest elements, hydrogen and helium, and discuss recent theoretical and experimental investigations of their properties at high pressure and temperature. Then, I discuss the impact of these properties, as well as of the equation of state of heavier elements, on planetary interiors. Finally, I highlight the importance of exoplanet transit observations and of the inferred mass-radius relationships to determine the planetary interior compositions.},

@article{Seager:2007,
	Abstract = {We use new interior models of cold planets to investigate the mass-radius relationships of solid exoplanets, considering planets made primarily of iron, silicates, water, and carbon compounds. We find that the mass-radius relationships for cold terrestrial mass planets of all compositions we considered follow a generic functional form that is not a simple power law: log10Rs=k1+1/3log10(Ms)-k2Mk3s for up to Mp~20 M⊕, where Ms and Rs are scaled mass and radius values. This functional form arises because the common building blocks of solid planets all have equations of state that are well approximated by a modified polytrope of the form rho=rho0+cPn. We find that highly detailed planet interior models, including temperature structure and phase changes, are not necessary to derive solid exoplanet bulk composition from mass and radius measurements. For solid exoplanets with no substantial atmosphere we have also found the following: with 5% fractional uncertainty in planet mass and radius it is possible to distinguish among planets composed predominantly of iron or silicates or water ice but not more detailed compositions; with ~5% uncertainty water ice planets with >~25% water by mass may be identified; the minimum plausible planet size for a given mass is that of a pure iron planet; and carbon planet mass-radius relationships overlap with those of silicate and water planets due to similar zero-pressure densities and equations of state. We propose a definition of ``super-Earths'' based on the clear distinction in radii between planets with significant gas envelopes and those without.},

@article{Adams:2008,
	Abstract = {The bulk composition of an exoplanet is commonly inferred from its average density. For small planets, however, the average density is not unique within the range of compositions. Variations of a number of important planetary parameters-which are difficult or impossible to constrain from measurements alone-produce planets with the same average densities but widely varying bulk compositions. We find that adding a gas envelope equivalent to 0.1%-10% of the mass of a solid planet causes the radius to increase 5%-60% above its gas-free value. A planet with a given mass and radius might have substantial water ice content (a so-called ocean planet), or alternatively a large rocky iron core and some H and/or He. For example, a wide variety of compositions can explain the observed radius of GJ 436b, although all models require some H/He. We conclude that the identification of water worlds based on the mass-radius relationship alone is impossible unless a significant gas layer can be ruled out by other means.},

	Abstract = {In this review, we summarize our present knowledge of the behaviour of the mass-radius relationship from solar-type stars down to terrestrial planets, across the regime of substellar objects, brown dwarfs and giant planets. Particular attention is paid to the identification of the main physical properties or mechanisms responsible for this behaviour. Indeed, understanding the mechanical structure of an object provides valuable information about its internal structure, composition and heat content as well as its formation history. Although the general description of these properties is reasonably well mastered, disagreement between theory and observation in certain cases points to some missing physics in our present modelling of at least some of these objects. The mass-radius relationship in the overlaping domain between giant planets and low-mass brown dwarfs is shown to represent a powerful diagnostic to distinguish between these two different populations and shows once again that the present IAU distinction between these two populations at a given mass has no valid foundation.},

@article{Grasset:2009,
	Abstract = {A mass-radius (M-R) relationship is proposed for solid planets and solid cores ranging from 1 to 100 Earth-mass planets. It relies on the assumption that solid spheres are composed of iron and silicates, around which a variable amount of water is added. The M-R law has been set up assuming that the planetary composition is similar to the averaged composition for silicates and iron obtained from the major elements ratio of 94 stars hosting exoplanets. Except on Earth for which a tremendous amount of data is available, the composition of silicate mantles and metallic cores cannot be constrained. Similarly, thermal profiles are poorly known. In this work, the effect of compositional parameters and thermal profiles on radii estimates is quantified. It will be demonstrated that uncertainties related to composition and temperature are secondary compared to the effect of the amount of water. The super-Earth family includes four classes of planets: iron-rich, silicate-rich, water-rich, or with a thick atmosphere. For a given mass, the planetary radius increases significantly from the iron-rich to the atmospheric-rich planet. Even if some overlaps are likely, M-R measurements could be accurate enough to ascertain the discovery of an Earth-like planet. The present work describes how the amount of water can be assessed from M-R measurements. Such an estimate depends on several assumptions including (1) the accuracy of the internal structure model and (2) the accuracy of mass and radius measurements. It is shown that if the mass and the radius are perfectly known, the standard deviation of the amount of water is about 4.5%. This value increases rapidly with the radius uncertainty but does not strongly depend on the mass uncertainty.},

@article{Swift:2012,
	Abstract = {For planets other than Earth, particularly exoplanets, interpretation of the composition and structure depends largely on comparing the mass and radius with the composition expected given their distance from the parent star. The composition implies a mass-radius relation which relies heavily on equations of state calculated from electronic structure theory and measured experimentally on Earth. We lay out a method for deriving and testing equations of state, and deduce mass-radius and mass-pressure relations for key, relevant materials whose equation of state (EOS) is reasonably well established, and for differentiated Fe/rock. We find that variations in the EOS, such as may arise when extrapolating from low-pressure data, can have significant effects on predicted mass-radius relations and on planetary pressure profiles. The relations are compared with the observed masses and radii of planets and exoplanets, broadly supporting recent inferences about exoplanet structures. Kepler-10b is apparently "Earth-like," likely with a proportionately larger core than Earth's, nominally 2/3 of the mass of the planet. CoRoT-7b is consistent with a rocky mantle over an Fe-based core which is likely to be proportionately smaller than Earth's. GJ 1214b lies between the mass-radius curves for H2O and CH4, suggesting an "icy" composition with a relatively large core or a relatively large proportion of H2O. CoRoT-2b is less dense than the hydrogen relation, which could be explained by an anomalously high degree of heating or by higher than assumed atmospheric opacity. HAT-P-2b is slightly denser than the mass-radius relation for hydrogen, suggesting the presence of a significant amount of matter of higher atomic number. CoRoT-3b lies close to the hydrogen relation. The pressure at the center of Kepler-10b is 1.5+1.2 - 1.0 TPa. The central pressure in CoRoT-7b is probably close to 0.8 TPa, though may be up to 2 TPa. These pressures are accessible by planar shock and ramp-loading experiments at large laser facilities. The center of HAT-P-2b is probably around 210 TPa, in the range of planned National Ignition Facility experiments, and that of CoRoT-3b around 1900 TPa.},

@article{Batygin:2013,
	Abstract = {Recently, the Kepler spacecraft has detected a sizable aggregate of objects, characterized by giant-planet-like radii and modest levels of stellar irradiation. With the exception of a handful of objects, the physical nature, and specifically the average densities, of these bodies remain unknown. Here, we propose that the detected giant planet radii may partially belong to planets somewhat less massive than Uranus and Neptune. Accordingly, in this work, we seek to identify a physically sound upper limit to planetary radii at low masses and moderate equilibrium temperatures. As a guiding example, we analyze the interior structure of the Neptune-mass planet Kepler-30d and show that it is acutely deficient in heavy elements, especially compared with its solar system counterparts. Subsequently, we perform numerical simulations of planetary thermal evolution and in agreement with previous studies, show that generally, 10-20 M ⊕, multi-billion year old planets, composed of high density cores and extended H/He envelopes can have radii that firmly reside in the giant planet range. We subject our results to stability criteria based on extreme ultraviolet radiation, as well as Roche-lobe overflow driven mass-loss and construct mass-radius relationships for the considered objects. We conclude by discussing observational avenues that may be used to confirm or repudiate the existence of putative low mass, gas-dominated planets.},

@article{Salpeter:1967,
	Abstract = {The correlation energy of the electron gas is treated as a perturbation on the total free energy computed for the zero-temperature Thomas-Fermi-Dirac (TFD) model of a solid. The contribution to the free energy is computed on the basis of two extreme assumptions: (i) The correlation energy is considered to be a local function of position inside the Wigner-Seitz sphere; and (ii) correlation forces are sufficiently long range so that the correlation part of the free energy is determined only by the average electron density. It is argued that (ii) is the more valid approach in the region of normal metallic densities. In terms of the parameter sa0, the radius of a sphere occupied by a single electron, an interpolation formula is developed for the correlation energy in the intermediate region between s≪1 (degenerate electron gas) and s∼60 (electron lattice-fluid phase transition). At extremely high densities, a series expansion in s is used to obtain an analytic expression for the electron pressure up to terms of order s3. For these high densities, prescriptions (i) and (ii) are equivalent. At lower densities, numerical results are presented for an assortment of elements for the TFD model, and TFD with correlations based on (i) and (ii). These are compared with shock-wave and seismic data, and the average correlation contribution computed from (ii) is found to be in better agreement than the other two procedures. A semiempirical formula is presented, which fits the numerical data to better than 0.5% for all pressures and atomic numbers, and reduces to the correct expression in the high-density limit. From this semiempirical formula, pressure-density curves are obtained for a variety of elements and minerals which have been considered as likely constituents of the core and mantle of the earth. A table of effective atomic numbers, to be used in the semiempirical formula, is given for the minerals.},

	Abstract = {We report on a spectroscopic determination of the atmospheric parameters and chemical abundance of the parent star of the recently discovered transiting planet TrES-2. A detailed LTE analysis of a set of Fe I and Fe II lines from our Keck spectra yields Teff=5850+/-50 K, logg=4.4+/-0.1, and [Fe/H]=-0.15+/-0.10. Several independent checks (e.g., additional spectroscopy, line-depth ratios) confirm the reliability of our spectroscopic Teff estimate. The mass and radius of the star, needed to determine the properties of the planet, are traditionally inferred by comparison with stellar evolution models using Teff and some measure of the stellar luminosity, such as the spectroscopic surface gravity. We apply here a new method in which we use instead of logg the normalized separation a/R* (related to the stellar density), directly measurabele from the light curves of transiting planets with much greater precision. With the a/R* value from the light-curve analysis of Holman and coworkers and our Teff estimate, we obtain M*=0.980+/-0.062 Msolar and R*=1.000+0.036-0.033 Rsolar, and an evolutionary age of 5.1+2.7-2.3 Gyr, in good agreement with other constraints (Ca II H and K line cores, lithium abundance, and rotation). The new stellar parameters yield improved values for the planetary mass and radius of Mp=1.198+/-0.053 MJ and Rp=1.220+0.045-0.042 RJ, confirming that TrES-2 is the most massive among the currently known nearby (d<~300 pc) transiting hot Jupiters. The surface gravity of the planet, loggp=3.299+/-0.016, can be derived independently of the knowledge of the stellar parameters (i.e., directly from observations), and with a very high precision rivaling that of the best known double-lined eclipsing binaries.},

@article{Reese:2012,
	Abstract = {Context. Determining the mass of stars is crucial both for improving stellar evolution theory and for characterising exoplanetary systems. Asteroseismology offers a promising way for estimating the stellar mean density. When combined with accurate radii determinations, such as are expected from Gaia, this yields accurate stellar masses. The main difficulty is finding the best way to extract the mean density of a star from a set of observed frequencies.  Aims: We seek to establish a new method for estimating the stellar mean density, which combines the simplicity of a scaling law while providing the accuracy of an inversion technique.  Methods: We provide a framework in which to construct and evaluate kernel-based linear inversions that directly yield the mean density of a star. We then describe three different inversion techniques (SOLA and two scaling laws) and apply them to the Sun, several test cases and three stars, alpha Cen B, HD 49933 and HD 49385, two of which are observed by CoRoT.  Results: The SOLA (subtractive optimally localised averages) approach and the scaling law based on the surface correcting technique described by Kjeldsen et al. (2008, ApJ, 683, L175) yield comparable results that can reach an accuracy of 0.5% and are better than scaling the large frequency separation. The reason for this is that the averaging kernels from the two first methods are comparable in quality and are better than what is obtained with the large frequency separation. It is also shown that scaling the large frequency separation is more sensitive to near-surface effects, but is much less affected by an incorrect mode identification. As a result, one can identify pulsation modes by looking for an l and n assignment which provides the best agreement between the results from the large frequency separation and those from one of the two other methods. Non-linear effects are also discussed, as is the effects of mixed modes. In particular, we show that mixed modes bring little improvement to the mean density estimates because of their poorly adapted kernels.},

	Abstract = {One of the objectives of the CoRoT mission is the search for transiting extrasolar planets using high-precision photometry, and the accurate charac- terization of their fundamental parameters. The CoRoT satellite consecutively observes crowded stellar fields since February 2007, in high-cadence precise pho- tometry; periodic eclipses are detected and analysed in the stellar light curves. Then complementary observations using ground-based facilities allows estab- lishing the nature of the transiting body and its mass. CoRoT has acquired more than 163000 light curves and detected about 500 planet candidates. A fraction of them (5%) are confirmed planets whose masses are independently measured. Main highlights of the CoRoT discoveries are: i) the variety of inter- nal structures in close-in giant planets, ii) the characterisation of the first known transiting rocky planet, CoRoT-7 b, iii) multiple constraints on the formation, evolution, role of tides in planetary systems.},

	Abstract = {Motivated by recent discoveries of low-density super-Earths with short orbital periods, we have investigated in situ accretion of H-He atmospheres on rocky bodies embedded in dissipating warm disks, by simulating quasi-static evolution of atmospheres that connect to the ambient disk. We have found that the atmospheric evolution has two distinctly different outcomes, depending on the rocky body's mass: while the atmospheres on massive rocky bodies undergo runaway disk-gas accretion, those on light rocky bodies undergo significant erosion during disk dispersal. In the atmospheric erosion, the heat content of the rocky body that was previously neglected plays an important role. We have also realized that the atmospheric mass is rather sensitive to disk temperature in the mass range of interest in this study. Our theory is applied to recently detected super-Earths orbiting Kepler-11 to examine the possibility that the planets are rock-dominated ones with relatively thick H-He atmospheres. The application suggests that the in situ formation of the relatively thick H-He atmospheres inferred by structure modeling is possible only under restricted conditions, namely, relatively slow disk dissipation and/or cool environments. This study demonstrates that low-density super-Earths provide important clues to understanding of planetary accretion and disk evolution.},

	Abstract = {The high density of the recently discovered close-in extrasolar planet HD 149026b suggests the presence of a huge core in its interior, which challenges planet formation theory. We first derive constraints on the total mass of heavy elements in the planet and find its preferred value is 50-80 M⊕ . We then explore the possibility of the formation of HD 149026b through subcritical core accretion as envisioned for Uranus and Neptune, and find the subcritical accretion scenario is very unlikely in the case of HD 149026b for at least two reasons: (1) subcritical planets are such that the ratio of their core mass to their total mass is above ~0.7, in contradiction with constraints for all but the most extreme interior models of HD 149026b and (2) high accretion rates and large isolation mass required for the formation of a subcritical >50 M⊕ core are possible only at specific orbital distances in a disk with a surface density of dust equal to at least 30 times that of the minimum-mass solar nebula. These facts point toward two main routes for the formation of HD 149026b: (i) gas accretion limited by a slow viscous inflow in an evaporating disk or (ii) a significant modification of the planetary composition after gas accretion ended. Illustrating the second route, we show that collision between two gas giants leads to a substantial loss of the gas component and thus may make the planet highly enriched in heavy elements. Alternatively, the planet may be supplied with heavy elements by planetesimals through secular perturbations. In both the giant impact and the secular perturbation scenarios, we expect an outer giant planet to be present. Observational studies by imaging, astrometry, and long-term interferometry of this system are needed to better narrow down the ensemble of possibilities.},

	Abstract = {From an astrobiological point of view, special attention has been paid to the probability of habitable planets in extrasolar systems. The purpose of this study is to constrain a possible range of the mass of a terrestrial planet that can get water. We focus on the process of water production through oxidation of atmospheric hydrogen-the nebular gas having been attracted gravitationally-by oxides available at the planetary surface. For the water production to work well on a planet, a sufficient amount of hydrogen and a temperature high enough to melt the planetary surface are needed. We have simulated the structure of the atmosphere that connects with the protoplanetary nebula for wide ranges of the heat flux, the opacity, and the density of the nebular gas. We have found that both requirements are fulfilled for an Earth-mass planet for wide ranges of the parameters. We have also found that the surface temperature of planets of <=0.3ME (where ME is Earth's mass) is lower than the melting temperature of silicate (~1500 K). On the other hand, a planet of more than several ME becomes a gas giant through runaway accretion of the nebular gas.},

We explore different compositions and obtain a scaling law of R∝M for Super-Earths. We also study a second family of planets, Super-Mercuries with masses ranging from one mercury-mass to ten mercury-masses with similar composition to the Earth's but with a larger core mass fraction.

	Abstract = {With improving methods and surveys, the young field of extrasolar planet studies has recently expanded into a qualitatively new domain-terrestrial (mostly rocky) planets. The first such planets were discovered during the past year and a half, judging by their measured masses of less than 10 M⊕ (``super-Earths''). They are introducing a novel physical regime that has not been explored before, as such planets do not exist in our solar system. Their compositions can be completely terrestrial, or they may harbor an extensive ocean (water and ices) above a rocky core. We model the structure and properties of the first super-Earth (mass ~7.5 M⊕), discovered in 2005, illustrating the possible compositions and providing radius evaluations in view of future detection of similar planets by transits. We find that there exists a threshold in radius above which a super-Earth most certainly has an extensive water content. In the case of GJ 876d, this threshold is at about 12,000 km. Our results show that unique characterization of the bulk composition of super-Earths will be possible with future transit studies.},

	Abstract = {We report on new transit photometry for the super-Earth 55 Cnc e obtained with Warm Spitzer/IRAC at 4.5 mum. An individual analysis of these new data leads to a planet radius of 2.21-0.16+0.15 R⊕, which agrees well with the values previously derived from the MOST and Spitzer transit discovery data. A global analysis of both Spitzer transit time-series improves the precision on the radius of the planet at 4.5 mum to 2.20 $\pm$ 0.12 R⊕. We also performed an independent analysis of the MOST data, paying particular attention to the influence of the systematic effects of instrumental origin on the derived parameters and errors by including them in a global model instead of performing a preliminary detrending-filtering processing. We deduce an optical planet radius of 2.04 $\pm$ 0.15 R⊕ from this reanalysis of MOST data, which is consistent with the previous MOST result and with our Spitzer infrared radius. Assuming the achromaticity of the transit depth, we performed a global analysis combining Spitzer and MOST data that results in a planet radius of 2.17 $\pm$ 0.10 R⊕ (13 820 $\pm$ 620 km). These results point to 55 Cnc e having a gaseous envelope overlying a rocky nucleus, in agreement with previous works. A plausible composition for the envelope is water which would be in super-critical form given the equilibrium temperature of the planet.

	Abstract = {The field of extrasolar planets has rapidly expanded to include the detection of planets with masses smaller than that of Uranus. Many of these are expected to have little or no hydrogen and helium gas, and we might find Earth analogs among them. In this paper we describe our detailed interior models for a rich variety of such massive terrestrial and ocean planets in the 1-10 M⊕ range (super-Earths). The grid presented here allows the characterization of the bulk composition of super-Earths detected in transit and with a measured mass. We show that, on average, planet radius measurements to better than 5%, combined with mass measurements to better than 10%, would permit us to distinguish between an icy or rocky composition. This is due to the fact that there is a maximum radius a rocky terrestrial planet may achieve for a given mass. Any value of the radius above this maximum terrestrial radius implies that the planet contains a large (>10%) amount of water (ocean planet).},

@phdthesis{Valencia:2008,
	Abstract = {We present a theoretical framework to characterize the structure, composition and thermal state of super-Earths. Super-Earths are the newest and smallest class of discovered exoplanets with masses ranging between 1-10 M (+) . They are exceptionally interesting objects because as they do not exist in our solar system, we know little about them; and as they bear a relation to the Terrestrial and Icy planets, they provide a unique opportunity to understand our solar system in a broader planetary context. To build this framework I developed a detailed internal structure model for Super-Earths.  To help interpret the expected data on exoplanets, we derived a comprehensive relationship between mass, radius and composition for super-Earths. These exoplanets can be either rocky or ocean-like. We showed that there is a strong degeneracy in composition so that a single average density measurement can be satisfied by many different bulk compositions. This is due to the available trade-offs between the three end member components: silicate mantle, iron core and water/ice layer. Nevertheless, we found that a terrestrial threshold radius exists above which the planet is necessarily ocean-like for a given planetary mass. This can be used to infer planetary type. To provide transit searches with an adequate mass-radius relationship we investigated how the radius would increase for planets with a similar Fe/Si ratio and different water/ice mass fractions (IMF). We find that the power law relationship is R/R (+) = (1+0.56 x IMF)( M/M (+) ) 0.262(1-0.138×IMF) The exponent of 0.262 is mostly controlled by the pressure regime. Terrestrial planets with 5-50% M (+) scale as R ~ M0.3 due to their relatively smaller central pressures. Uncertainties in temperature profile, including differences of thousands of degrees in surface temperatures, amount of core-mass fraction, or minor elements in the mineral composition do not map significantly into the exponent. This makes the relationship robust and useful.  To investigate the thermal state of super-Earths, we used an analytical parameterized convection analysis in conjunction with the structure model to show that the conditions for plate subduction are more favourable on super- Earths than on Earth. Therefore, these exoplanets are likely to have plate tectonics, which makes them attractive targets in the search for habitable planets.},

	Abstract = {We report on the detection of a transit of the super-Earth 55 Cnc e with warm Spitzer in IRAC's 4.5 mum band. Our MCMC analysis includes an extensive modeling of the systematic effects affecting warm Spitzer photometry, and yields a transit depth of 410 $\pm$ 63 ppm, which translates to a planetary radius of 2.08+0.16-0.17 R_oplus as measured in IRAC 4.5 mum channel. A planetary mass of 7.81-0.53+0.58 M_oplus is derived from an extensive set of radial-velocity data, yielding a mean planetary density of 4.78-1.20+1.31 g cm-3. Thanks to the brightness of its host star (V = 6, K = 4), 55 Cnc e is a unique target for the thorough characterization of a super-Earth orbiting around a solar-type star.

The discovery of CoRoT-7b, a planet of a radius 1.68$\pm$0.09 R_⊕, a mass 4.8$\pm$0.8 M_⊕, and an orbital period of 0.854 days demonstrates that small planets can orbit extremely close to their star.  Aims: Several questions arise concerning this planet, in particular concerning its possible composition, and fate.  Methods: We use knowledge of hot Jupiters, mass loss estimates and models for the interior structure and evolution of planets to understand its composition, structure and evolution.  Results: The inferred mass and radius of CoRoT-7b are consistent with a rocky planet that would be significantly depleted in iron relative to the Earth. However, a one sigma increase in mass (5.6 M_⊕) and one sigma decrease in size (1.59 R_⊕) would make the planet compatible with an Earth-like composition (33% iron, 67% silicates). Alternatively, it is possible that CoRoT-7b contains a significant amount of volatiles. For a planet made of an Earth-like interior and an outer volatile-rich vapour envelope, an equally good fit to the measured mass and radius is found for a mass of the vapour envelope equal to 3% (and up to 10% at most) of the planetary mass. Because of its intense irradiation and small size, we determine that the planet cannot possess an envelope of hydrogen and helium of more than 1/10 000 of its total mass. We show that a relatively significant mass loss ~1011 g s-1 is to be expected and that it should prevail independently of the planet's composition. This is because to first order, the hydrodynamical escape rate is independent of the mean molecular mass of the atmosphere, and because given the intense irradiation, even a bare rocky planet would be expected to possess an equilibrium vapour atmosphere thick enough to capture stellar UV photons. Clearly, this escape rate rules out the possibility that a hydrogen-helium envelope is present, as it would escape in only ~1 Ma. A water vapour atmosphere would escape in ~1 Ga, indicating that this is a plausible scenario. The origin of CoRoT-7b cannot be inferred from the present observations: It may have always had a rocky composition; it may be the remnant of a Uranus-like ice giant, or a gas giant with a small core that has been stripped of its gaseous envelope.  Conclusions: With high enough sensitivity, spectroscopic transit observations of CoRoT-7 should constrain the composition of the evaporating flow and therefore allow us to distinguish between a rocky planet and a volatile-rich vapour planet. In addition, the theoretical tools developed in this study are applicable to any short-period transiting super-Earth and will be important to understanding their origins.},

	Abstract = {We report the strategy and results of our radial velocity follow-up campaign with the SOPHIE spectrograph (1.93-m OHP) of four transiting planetary candidates discovered by the Kepler space mission. We discuss the selection of the candidates KOI-428, KOI-410, KOI-552, and KOI-423. KOI-428 was established as a hot Jupiter transiting the largest and the most evolved star discovered so far and is described by Santerne et al. (2011, A&A, 528, A63). KOI-410 does not present radial velocity change greater than 120 m s-1, which allows us to exclude at 3sigma a transiting companion heavier than 3.4 MJup. KOI-552b appears to be a transiting low-mass star with a mass ratio of 0.15. KOI-423b is a new transiting companion in the overlapping region between massive planets and brown dwarfs. With a radius of 1.22 $\pm$ 0.11 RJup and a mass of 18.0 $\pm$ 0.92 MJup, KOI-423b is orbiting an F7IV star with a period of 21.0874 $\pm$ 0.0002 days and an eccentricity of 0.12 $\pm$ 0.02. From the four selected Kepler candidates, at least three of them have a Jupiter-size transiting companion, but two of them are not in the mass domain of Jupiter-like planets. KOI-423b and KOI-522b are members of a growing population of known massive companions orbiting close to an F-type star. This population currently appears to be absent around G-type stars, possibly due to their rapid braking and the engulfment of their companions by tidal decay.  Based on observations made with the 1.93-m telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence (CNRS), France.},

	Abstract = {Context. CoRoT is a pioneering space mission whose primary goals are stellar seismology and extrasolar planets search. Its surveys of large stellar fields generate numerous planetary candidates whose lightcurves have transit-like features. An extensive analytical and observational follow-up effort is undertaken to classify these candidates.  Aims: We present the list of planetary transit candidates from the CoRoT LRa01 star field in the Monoceros constellation toward the Galactic anti-center direction. The CoRoT observations of LRa01 lasted from 24 October 2007 to 3 March 2008.  Methods: We acquired and analyzed 7470 chromatic and 3938 monochromatic lightcurves. Instrumental noise and stellar variability were treated with several filtering tools by different teams from the CoRoT community. Different transit search algorithms were applied to the lightcurves.  Results: Fifty-one stars were classified as planetary transit candidates in LRa01. Thirty-seven (i.e., 73% of all candidates) are "good" planetary candidates based on photometric analysis only. Thirty-two (i.e., 87% of the "good" candidates) have been followed-up. At the time of writing twenty-two cases were solved and five planets were discovered: three transiting hot-Jupiters (CoRoT-5b, CoRoT-12b, and CoRoT-21b), the first terrestrial transiting planet (CoRoT-7b), and another planet in the same system (CoRoT-7c, detected by radial velocity survey only). Evidence of another non-transiting planet in the CoRoT-7 system, namely CoRoT-7d, was recently found as well.  The CoRoT space mission, launched on December 27, 2006, has been developed and is operated by CNES, with contributions of Austria, Belgium, Brazil, ESA (RSSD and Science Program), Germany and Spain.},

	Abstract = {The discovery of multiple transiting planetary systems offers new possibilities for characterising exoplanets and understanding their formation. The Kepler-9 system contains two Saturn-mass planets, Kepler-9b and 9c. Using evolution models of gas giants that reproduce the sizes of known transiting planets and accounting for all sources of uncertainties, we show that Kepler-9b (respectively 9c) contains 45+17-12 M⊕ (resp. 31+13-10 M⊕) of hydrogen and helium and 35+10-15 M⊕ (resp. 24+10-12 M⊕) of heavy elements. More accurate constraints are obtained when comparing planets 9b and 9c: the ratio of the total mass fractions of heavy elements are Zb/Zc = 1.02 $\pm$ 0.14, indicating that, although the masses of the planets differ, their global composition is very similar, an unexpected result for formation models. Using evolution models for super-Earths, we find that Kepler-9d must contain less than 0.1% of its mass in hydrogen and helium and predict a mostly rocky structure with a total mass between 4 and 16 M⊕.

	Abstract = {Of the over 400 known exoplanets, there are about 70 planets that transit their central star, a situation that permits the derivation of their basic parameters and facilitates investigations of their atmospheres. Some short-period planets, including the first terrestrial exoplanet (CoRoT-7b), have been discovered using a space mission designed to find smaller and more distant planets than can be seen from the ground. Here we report transit observations of CoRoT-9b, which orbits with a period of 95.274days on a low eccentricity of 0.11+/-0.04 around a solar-like star. Its periastron distance of 0.36 astronomical units is by far the largest of all transiting planets, yielding a `temperate' photospheric temperature estimated to be between 250 and 430K. Unlike previously known transiting planets, the present size of CoRoT-9b should not have been affected by tidal heat dissipation processes. Indeed, the planet is found to be well described by standard evolution models with an inferred interior composition consistent with that of Jupiter and Saturn.},

	Abstract = {The CoRoT space observatory is a project which is led by the French space agency CNES and leading space research institutes in Austria, Brazil, Belgium, Germany and Spain and also the European Space Agency ESA. CoRoT observed since its launch in December 27, 2006 about 100 000 stars for the exoplanet channel, during 150 days uninterrupted high-precision photometry. Since the The CoRoT-team has several exoplanet candidates which are currently analyzed under its study, we report here the discoveries of nine exoplanets which were observed by CoRoT. Discovered exoplanets such as CoRoT-3b populate the brown dwarf desert and close the gap of measured physical properties between usual gas giants and very low mass stars. CoRoT discoveries extended the known range of planet masses down to about 4.8 Earth-masses (CoRoT-7b) and up to 21 Jupiter masses (CoRoT-3b), the radii to about 1.68 × 0.09 R Earth (CoRoT-7b) and up to the most inflated hot Jupiter with 1.49 × 0.09 R Earth found so far (CoRoT-1b), and the transiting exoplanet with the longest period of 95.274 days (CoRoT-9b). Giant exoplanets have been detected at low metallicity, rapidly rotating and active, spotted stars. Two CoRoT planets have host stars with the lowest content of heavy elements known to show a transit hinting towards a different planethost-star-metallicity relation then the one found by radial-velocity search programs. Finally the properties of the CoRoT-7b prove that rocky planets with a density close to Earth exist outside the Solar System. Finally the detection of the secondary transit of CoRoT-1b at a sensitivity level of 10-5 and the very clear detection of the "super-Earth" CoRoT-7b at 3.5 × 10-4 relative flux are promising evidence that the space observatory is being able to detect even smaller exoplanets with the size of the Earth.},

	Abstract = {Context: The CoRoT mission, a pioneer in exoplanet searches from space, has completed its first 150 days of continuous observations of ~12 000 stars in the galactic plane. An analysis of the raw data identifies the most promising candidates and triggers the ground-based follow-up. Aims: We report on the discovery of the transiting planet CoRoT-Exo-2b, with a period of 1.743 days, and characterize its main parameters. Methods: We filter the CoRoT raw light curve of cosmic impacts, orbital residuals, and low frequency signals from the star. The folded light curve of 78 transits is fitted to a model to obtain the main parameters. Radial velocity data obtained with the SOPHIE, CORALIE and HARPS spectrographs are combined to characterize the system. The 2.5 min binned phase-folded light curve is affected by the effect of sucessive occultations of stellar active regions by the planet, and the dispersion in the out of transit part reaches a level of 1.09×10-4 in flux units.  Results: We derive a radius for the planet of 1.465 $\pm$ 0.029 R_Jup and a mass of 3.31 $\pm$ 0.16 M_Jup, corresponding to a density of 1.31 $\pm$ 0.04 g/cm^3. The large radius of CoRoT-Exo-2b cannot be explained by current models of evolution of irradiated planets.  Based on observations obtained with CoRoT, a space project operated by the French Space Agency, CNES, with participation of the Science Programme of ESA, ESTEC/RSSD, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Germany and Spain; and on observations made with SOPHIE spectrograph at Observatoire de Haute Provence, France (PNP.07 A.MOUT), CORALIE, and HARPS spectrograph at ESO La Silla Observatroy (079.C-0127/F)).

@article{Deleuil:2008,
	Abstract = {Context: The CoRoT space mission routinely provides high-precision photometric measurements of thousands of stars that have been continuously observed for months.  Aims: The discovery and characterization of the first very massive transiting planetary companion with a short orbital period is reported.  Methods: A series of 34 transits was detected in the CoRoT light curve of an F3V star, observed from May to October 2007 for 152 days. The radius was accurately determined and the mass derived for this new transiting, thanks to the combined analysis of the light curve and complementary ground-based observations: high-precision radial-velocity measurements, on-off photometry, and high signal-to-noise spectroscopic observations. Results: CoRoT-Exo-3b has a radius of 1.01 $\pm$ 0.07 R_Jup and transits around its F3-type primary every 4.26 days in a synchronous orbit. Its mass of 21.66 $\pm$ 1.0 M_Jup, density of 26.4 $\pm$ 5.6 g cm-3, and surface gravity of logg = 4.72 clearly distinguish it from the regular close-in planet population, making it the most intriguing transiting substellar object discovered so far. Conclusions: With the current data, the nature of CoRoT-Exo-3b is ambiguous, as it could either be a low-mass brown-dwarf or a member of a new class of ``superplanets''. Its discovery may help constrain the evolution of close-in planets and brown-dwarfs better. Finally, CoRoT-Exo-3b confirms the trend that massive transiting giant planets (M >= 4 M_Jup) are found preferentially around more massive stars than the Sun.  The CoRoT space mission, launched on December 27th 2006, has been developed and is operating by CNES, with the contribution of Austria, Belgium, Brasil, ESA, Germany and Spain.

	Abstract = {Context: The pioneer space mission for photometric planet searches, CoRoT, steadily monitors about 12 000 stars in each of its fields of view. Transit candidates can be detected early in the processing of the data and before the end of a run of observation.  Aims: We report the detection of the first planet discovered by CoRoT and characterizing it with the help of follow-up observations.  Methods: Raw data were filtered from outliers and residuals at the orbital period of the satellite. The orbital parameters and the radius of the planet were estimated by best fitting the phase folded light curve with 34 successive transits. Doppler measurements with the SOPHIE spectrograph permitted us to secure the detection against binaries and to estimate the mass of the planet.  Results: The accuracy of the data is very high with a dispersion in the 2.17 min binned phase-folded light curve that does not exceed ~3.×10-4 in flux unit. The planet orbits a mildly metal-poor G0V star of magnitude V=13.6 in 1.5 days. The estimated mass and radius of the star are 0.95$\pm$0.15 M&sun; and 1.11$\pm$0.05 R&sun;. We find the planet has a radius of 1.49$\pm$0.08 R_Jup, a mass of 1.03$\pm$0.12 M_Jup, and a particularly low mean density of 0.38$\pm$0.05 g cm-3.

	Abstract = {Aims: The CoRoT satellite has announced its fourth transiting planet (Aigrain et al. 2008, A&A, 488, L43) with space photometry. We describe and analyse complementary observations of this system performed to establish the planetary nature of the transiting body and to estimate the fundamental parameters of the planet and its parent star.  Methods: We have analysed high precision radial-velocity data, ground-based photometry, and high signal-to-noise ratio spectroscopy. Results: The parent star CoRoT-Exo-4 (2MASS 06484671-0040219) is a late F-type star of mass of 1.16 M&sun; and radius of 1.17 R&sun;. The planet has a circular orbit with a period of 9.20205 d. The planet radius is 1.19 R_Jup and the mass is 0.72 M_Jup. It is a gas-giant planet with a ``normal'' internal structure of mainly H and He. CoRoT-Exo-4b has the second longest period of the known transiting planets. It is an important discovery since it occupies an empty area in the mass-period diagram of transiting exoplanets.  Based on observations obtained with CoRoT, a space project operated by the French Space Agency, CNES, with participation of the Science Programme of ESA, ESTEC/RSSD, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Germany and Spain; and on observations made with the SOPHIE spectrograph at Observatoire de Haute Provence, France (PNP.07B.MOUT), and the HARPS spectrograph at ESO La Silla Observatory (079.C-0127/F).

By modeling the radial velocity anomaly occurring during the transit due to the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, we determine the sky-projected angle between the stellar spin and the planetary orbital axis to be close to zero lambda = 7.2 $\pm$ 4.5 deg, and we secure the planetary nature of CoRoT-Exo-2b.

@article{Aigrain:2008,
	Abstract = {CoRoT, the first space-based transit search, provides ultra-high-precision light curves with continuous time-sampling over periods of up to 5 months. This allows the detection of transiting planets with relatively long periods, and the simultaneous study of the host star's photometric variability. In this Letter, we report the discovery of the transiting giant planet CoRoT-Exo-4b and use the CoRoT light curve to perform a detailed analysis of the transit and determine the stellar rotation period. The CoRoT light curve was pre-processed to remove outliers and correct for orbital residuals and artefacts due to hot pixels on the detector. After removing stellar variability about each transit, the transit light curve was analysed to determine the transit parameters. A discrete autocorrelation function method was used to derive the rotation period of the star from the out-of-transit light curve. We determine the periods of the planetary orbit and star's rotation of 9.20205 $\pm$ 0.00037 and 8.87 $\pm$ 1.12 days respectively, which is consistent with this being a synchronised system. We also derive the inclination, i = 90.00_-0.085+0.000 in degrees, the ratio of the orbital distance to the stellar radius, a/Rs = 17.36-0.25+0.05, and the planet-to-star radius ratio R_p/R_s=0.1047-0.0022+0.0041. We discuss briefly the coincidence between the orbital period of the planet and the stellar rotation period and its possible implications for the system's migration and star-planet interaction history.  The CoRoT space mission, launched on  December 27th 2006, has been developed and is operated by  CNES, with the contribution of Austria, Belgium, Brazil, ESA,  Germany, and Spain.

	Abstract = {Aims: The CoRoT space mission continues to photometrically monitor about 12 000 stars in its field-of-view for a series of target fields to search for transiting extrasolar planets ever since 2007. Deep transit signals can be detected quickly in the ``alarm-mode'' in parallel to the ongoing target field monitoring. CoRoT's first planets have been detected in this mode.  Methods: The CoRoT raw lightcurves are filtered for orbital residuals, outliers, and low-frequency stellar signals. The phase folded lightcurve is used to fit the transit signal and derive the main planetary parameters. Radial velocity follow-up observations were initiated to secure the detection and to derive the planet mass.  Results: We report the detection of CoRoT-5b, detected during observations of the LRa01 field, the first long-duration field in the galactic anti-center direction. CoRoT-5b is a ``hot Jupiter-type'' planet with a radius of 1.388+0.046-0.047 R_Jup, a mass of 0.467+0.047-0.024 M_Jup, and therefore, a mean density of 0.217+0.031-0.025 g cm-3. The planet orbits an F9V star of 14.0 mag in 4.0378962 $\pm$ 0.0000019 days at an orbital distance of 0.04947+0.00026-0.00029 AU.  Observations made with SOPHIE spectrograph at the Observatoire de Haute Provence (07B.PNP.MOUT), France, and HARPS spectrograph at ESO La Silla Observatory (072.C-0488(E), 082.C-0312(A)), and partly based on observations made at the Anglo-Australian Telescope.

	Abstract = {Asteroseismic data can be used to determine stellar surface gravities with precisions of <0.05 dex by using the global seismic quantities <Deltanu> and numax along with standard atmospheric data such as Teff and metallicity. Surface gravity is also one of the four stellar properties to be derived by automatic analyses for one billion stars from Gaia data (workpackage GSP_PHOT). In this paper, we explore seismic data from main-sequence F, G, K stars (solar-like stars) observed by the Kepler spacecraft as a potential calibration source for the methods that Gaia will use for object characterization (log g). We calculate log g for some bright nearby stars for which radii and masses are known (e.g. from interferometry or binaries), and using their global seismic quantities in a grid-based method, we determine an asteroseismic log g to within 0.01 dex of the direct calculation, thus validating the accuracy of our method. We also find that errors in adopted atmospheric parameters (mainly [Fe/H]) can, however, cause systematic errors of the order of 0.02 dex. We then apply our method to a list of 40 stars to deliver precise values of surface gravity, i.e. uncertainties of the order of 0.02 dex, and we find agreement with recent literature values. Finally, we explore the typical precision that we expect in a sample of more than 400 Kepler stars which have their global seismic quantities measured. We find a mean uncertainty (precision) of the order of better than 0.02 dex in log g over the full explored range 3.8 < log g < 4.6, with the mean value varying only with stellar magnitude (0.01-0.02 dex). We study sources of systematic errors in log g and find possible biases of the order of 0.04 dex, independent of log g and magnitude, which accounts for errors in the Teff and [Fe/H] measurements, as well as from using a different grid-based method. We conclude that Kepler stars provide a wealth of reliable information that can help to calibrate methods that Gaia will use, in particular, for source characterization with GSP_PHOT, where excellent precision (small uncertainties) and accuracy in log g is obtained from seismic data.},

	Abstract = {CoRoT-21, a F8IV star of magnitude V = 16 mag, was observed by the space telescope CoRoT during the Long Run 01 (LRa01) in the first winter field (constellation Monoceros) from October 2007 to March 2008. Transits were discovered during the light curve processing. Radial velocity follow-up observations, however, were performed mainly by the 10-m Keck telescope in January 2010. The companion CoRoT-21b is a Jupiter-like planet of 2.26 $\pm$ 0.33 Jupiter masses and 1.30 $\pm$ 0.14 Jupiter radii in an circular orbit of semi-major axis 0.0417 $\pm$ 0.0011 AU and an orbital period of 2.72474 $\pm$ 0.00014 days. The planetary bulk density is (1.36 $\pm$ 0.48) × 103 kg m-3, very similar to the bulk density of Jupiter, and follows an M1/3 - R relation like Jupiter. The F8IV star is a sub-giant star of 1.29 $\pm$ 0.09 solar masses and 1.95 $\pm$ 0.2 solar radii. The star and the planet exchange extremetidal forces that will lead to orbital decay and extreme spin-up of the stellar rotation within 800 Myr if the stellar dissipation is Q*/k2* <= 107.  The CoRoT space mission, launched on December 27th 2006, has been developed and is operated by CNES, with the contribution of Austria, Belgium, Brazil, ESA (RSSD and Science Programme), Germany and Spain.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We present an extension of our investigations on limb-darkening coefficients computed with spherical symmetrical Phoenix models. The models investigated in this paper cover the range 5000 K <= Teff <= 10 000 K and complete our previous studies of low effective temperatures computed with the same code.  Methods: The limb-darkening coefficients are computed for the transmission curves of the Kepler, CoRoT, and Spitzer space missions and the Str{\"o}mgren, Johnson-Cousins, Sloan, and 2MASS passbands. These computations were performed by adopting the least-squares method.  Results: We have used six laws to describe the specific intensity distribution: linear, quadratic, square root, logarithmic, exponential, and a general law with four terms. The computations are presented for the solar chemical composition and cover the range 3.0 <= log g <= 5.5. The adopted microturbulent velocity and the mixing-length parameter are 2.0 km s-1 and 2.0.

@article{Moses:2013,
	Abstract = {Motivated by recent spectroscopic evidence for carbon-rich atmospheres on some transiting exoplanets, we investigate the influence of the C/O ratio on the chemistry, composition, and spectra of extrasolar giant planets both from a thermochemical equilibrium perspective and from consideration of disequilibrium processes like photochemistry and transport-induced quenching. We find that although CO is predicted to be a major atmospheric constituent on hot Jupiters for all C/O ratios, other oxygen-bearing molecules like H2O and CO2 are much more abundant when C/O < 1, whereas CH4, HCN, and C2H2 gain significantly in abundance when C/O > 1. Other notable species like N2 and NH3 that do not contain carbon or oxygen are relatively unaffected by the C/O ratio. Disequilibrium processes tend to enhance the abundance of CH4, NH3, HCN, and C2H2 over a wide range of C/O ratios. We compare the results of our models with secondary-eclipse photometric data from the Spitzer Space Telescope and conclude that (1) disequilibrium models with C/O ~ 1 are consistent with spectra of WASP-12b, XO-1b, and CoRoT-2b, confirming the possible carbon-rich nature of these planets; (2) spectra from HD 189733b are consistent with C/O lsim 1, but as the assumed metallicity is increased above solar, the required C/O ratio must increase toward 1 to prevent too much H2O absorption; (3) species like HCN can have a significant influence on spectral behavior in the 3.6 and 8.0 mum Spitzer channels, potentially providing even more opacity than CH4 when C/O > 1; and (4) the very high CO2 abundance inferred for HD 189733b from near-infrared observations cannot be explained through equilibrium or disequilibrium chemistry in a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere. We discuss possible formation mechanisms for carbon-rich hot Jupiters, including scenarios in which the accretion of CO-rich, H2O-poor gas dominates the atmospheric envelope, and scenarios in which the planets accrete carbon-rich solids while migrating through disk regions inward of the snow line. The C/O ratio and bulk atmospheric metallicity provide important clues regarding the formation and evolution of the giant planets.},

	Abstract = {We present results of a long-baseline interferometry campaign using the PAVO beam combiner at the CHARA Array to measure the angular sizes of five main-sequence stars, one subgiant and four red giant stars for which solar-like oscillations have been detected by either Kepler or CoRoT. By combining interferometric angular diameters, Hipparcos parallaxes, asteroseismic densities, bolometric fluxes, and high-resolution spectroscopy, we derive a full set of near-model-independent fundamental properties for the sample. We first use these properties to test asteroseismic scaling relations for the frequency of maximum power (numax) and the large frequency separation (Deltanu). We find excellent agreement within the observational uncertainties, and empirically show that simple estimates of asteroseismic radii for main-sequence stars are accurate to <~ 4%. We furthermore find good agreement of our measured effective temperatures with spectroscopic and photometric estimates with mean deviations for stars between T eff = 4600-6200 K of -22 $\pm$ 32 K (with a scatter of 97 K) and -58 $\pm$ 31 K (with a scatter of 93 K), respectively. Finally, we present a first comparison with evolutionary models, and find differences between observed and theoretical properties for the metal-rich main-sequence star HD 173701. We conclude that the constraints presented in this study will have strong potential for testing stellar model physics, in particular when combined with detailed modeling of individual oscillation frequencies.},

	Abstract = {We report the detection of CoRoT-23b, a hot Jupiter transiting in front of its host star with a period of 3.6314 $\pm$ 0.0001 days. This planet was discovered thanks to photometric data secured with the CoRoT satellite, combined with spectroscopic radial velocity (RV) measurements. A photometric search for possible background eclipsing binaries conducted at CFHT and OGS concluded with a very low risk of false positives. The usual techniques of combining RV and transit data simultaneously were used to derive stellar and planetary parameters. The planet has a mass of Mp = 2.8 $\pm$ 0.3 MJup, a radius of Rpl= 1.05 $\pm$ 0.13RJup, a density of ≈ 3 g cm-3. RV data also clearly reveal a nonzero eccentricity of e = 0.16 $\pm$ 0.02. The planet orbits a mature G0 main sequence star of V = 15.5 mag, with a mass M* = 1.14 $\pm$ 0.08 M&sun;, a radius R * = 1. 61 $\pm$ 0.18 R&sun; and quasi-solarabundances. The age of the system is evaluated to be 7 Gyr, not far from the transition to subgiant, in agreement with the rather large stellar radius. The two features of a significant eccentricity of the orbit and of a fairly high density are fairly uncommon for a hot Jupiter. The high density is, however, consistent with a model of contraction of a planet at this mass, given the age of the system. On the other hand, at such an age, circularization is expected to be completed. In fact, we show that for this planetary mass and orbital distance, any initial eccentricity should not totally vanish after 7 Gyr, as long as the tidal quality factor Qp is more than a few 105, a value that is the lower bound of the usually expected range. Even if CoRoT-23b features a density and an eccentricity that are atypical of a hot Jupiter, it is thus not an enigmatic object.  The CoRoT space mission, launched on 27 December 2006, has been developed and is operated by CNES, with the contribution of Austria, Belgium, Brazil, ESA, Germany, and Spain. First CoRoT data are available to the public from the CoRoT archive: http://idoc-corot.ias.u-psud.fr. The complementary observations were obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by NRC in Canada, INSU-CNRS in France, and the University of Hawaii; ESO Telescopes at the La Silla and Paranal Observatories under program 184.C0639; the OGS telescope operated by the Instituto de Astrof{\'\i}sica de Tenerife at Tenerife.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery by the CoRoT space mission of a new giant planet, CoRoT-20b. The planet has a mass of 4.24 $\pm$ 0.23 MJup and a radius of 0.84 $\pm$ 0.04 RJup. With a mean density of 8.87 $\pm$ 1.10 g cm-3, it is among the most compact planets known so far. Evolutionary models for the planet suggest a mass of heavy elements of the order of 800 M⊕ if embedded in a central core, requiring a revision either of the planet formation models or both planet evolution and structure models. We note however that smaller amounts of heavy elements are expected by more realistic models in which they are mixed throughout the envelope. The planet orbits a G-type star with an orbital period of 9.24 days and an eccentricity of 0.56.The star's projected rotational velocity is vsini = 4.5 $\pm$ 1.0 km s-1, corresponding to a spin period of 11.5 $\pm$ 3.1 days if its axis of rotation is perpendicular to the orbital plane. In the framework of Darwinian theories and neglecting stellar magnetic breaking, we calculate the tidal evolution of the system and show that CoRoT-20b is presently one of the very few Darwin-stable planets that is evolving toward a triple synchronous state with equality of the orbital, planetary and stellar spin periods.  The CoRoT space mission, launched on December 27th 2006, has been developed and is operated by CNES, with the contribution of Austria, Belgium, Brazil, ESA (RSSD and Science Programme), Germany, and Spain.},

	Abstract = {We report the detection of CoRoT-18b, a massive hot Jupiter transiting in front of its host star with a period of 1.9000693 $\pm$ 0.0000028 days. This planet was discovered thanks to photometric data secured with the CoRoT satellite combined with spectroscopic and photometric ground-based follow-up observations. The planet has a mass Mp = 3.47 $\pm$ 0.38 MJup, a radius Rp = 1.31 $\pm$ 0.18 RJup, and a density rhop = 2.2 $\pm$ 0.8 g cm-3. It orbits a G9V star with a mass M* = 0.95 $\pm$ 0.15 M&sun;, a radius R* = 1.00 $\pm$ 0.13 R&sun;, and arotation period Prot = 5.4 $\pm$ 0.4 days. The age of the system remains uncertain, with stellar evolution models pointing either to a few tens Ma or several Ga, while gyrochronology and lithium abundance point towards ages of a few hundred Ma. This mismatch potentially points to a problem in our understanding of the evolution of young stars, with possibly significant implications for stellar physics and the interpretation of inferred sizes of exoplanets around young stars. We detected the Rossiter-McLaughlin anomaly in the CoRoT-18 system thanks to the spectroscopic observation of a transit. We measured the obliquity psi = 20$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 20$\,^{\circ}$ (sky-projected value lambda = -10$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 20$\,^{\circ}$), indicating that the planet orbits in the same way as the star is rotating and that this prograde orbit is nearly aligned with the stellar equator.

	Abstract = {Context. Observations of transiting extrasolar planets are of key importance to our understanding of planets because their mass, radius, and mass density can be determined. These measurements indicate that planets of similar mass can have very different radii. For low-density planets, it is generally assumed that they are inflated owing to their proximity to the host-star. To determine the causes of this inflation, it is necessary to obtain a statistically significant sample of planets with precisely measured masses and radii.  Aims: The CoRoT space mission allows us to achieve a very high photometric accuracy. By combining CoRoT data with high-precision radial velocity measurements, we derive precise planetary radii and masses. We report the discovery of CoRoT-19b, a gas-giant planet transiting an old, inactive F9V-type star with a period of four days.  Methods: After excluding alternative physical configurations mimicking a planetary transit signal, we determine the radius and mass of the planet by combining CoRoT photometry with high-resolution spectroscopy obtained with the echelle spectrographs SOPHIE, HARPS, FIES, and SANDIFORD. To improve the precision of its ephemeris and the epoch, we observed additional transits with the TRAPPIST and Euler telescopes. Using HARPS spectra obtained during the transit, we then determine the projected angle between the spin of the star and the orbit of the planet.  Results: We find that the host star of CoRoT-19b is an inactive F9V-type star close to the end of its main-sequence life. The host star has a mass M* = 1.21 $\pm$ 0.05 M&sun; and radius R* = 1.65 $\pm$ 0.04 R&sun;. The planet has a mass of MP = 1.11 $\pm$ 0.06 MJup and radius of RP = 1.29 $\pm$ 0.03 RJup. The resulting bulk density is only rho = 0.71 $\pm$ 0.06 g cm-3, which is much lower than that for Jupiter.  Conclusions: The exoplanet CoRoT-19b is an example of a giant planet of almost the same mass as Jupiter but a ≈30% larger radius.  The CoRoT space mission, launched on December 27, 2006, has been developed and is operated by the CNES, with the contribution of Austria, Belgium, Brazil, ESA (RSSD and Science Program), Germany and Spain. Partly based on observations obtained at the European Southern Observatory at Paranal, Chile in program 184.C-0639, and partly based on observations conducted at McDonald Observatory.},

	Abstract = {We report on the discovery of a hot Jupiter-type exoplanet, CoRoT-17b, detected by the CoRoT satellite. It has a mass of 2.43 $\pm$ 0.30 MJup and a radius of 1.02 $\pm$ 0.07 RJup, while its mean density is 2.82 $\pm$ 0.38 g/cm3. CoRoT-17b is in a circular orbit with a period of 3.7681 $\pm$ 0.0003 days. The host star is an old (10.7 $\pm$ 1.0 Gyr) main-sequence star, which makes it an intriguing object for planetary evolution studies. The planet's internal composition is not well constrained and can range from pure H/He to one that can contain ~380 earth masses of heavier elements.

@article{Hatzes:2011,
	Abstract = {The mass of CoRoT-7b, the first transiting super-Earth exoplanet, is still a subject of debate. A wide range of masses have been reported in the literature ranging from as high as 8 M ⊕ to as low as 2.3 M ⊕. This range in mass is largely due to the activity level of the star that contributes a significant amount of radial velocity (RV) "jitter" and how the various methods correct this jitter. Although most mass determinations give a density consistent with a rocky planet, the lower value permits a bulk composition that can be up to 50% water. We present an analysis of the CoRoT-7b RV measurements that uses very few and simple assumptions in treating the activity signal. By analyzing those RV data for which multiple measurements were made in a given night, we remove the activity related RV contribution without any a priori model. We argue that the contribution of activity to the final RV curve is negligible and that the K-amplitude due to the planet is well constrained. This yields a mass of 7.42 $\pm$ 1.21 M ⊕ and a mean density of rho = 10.4 $\pm$ 1.8 gm cm-3. CoRoT-7b is similar in mass and radius to the second rocky planet to be discovered, Kepler-10b, and within the errors they have identical bulk densities---they are virtual twins. These bulk densities lie close to the density-radius relationship for terrestrial planets similar to what is seen for Mercury. CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b may have an internal structure more like Mercury than the Earth.},

	Abstract = {CoRoT-2 is one of the most unusual planetary systems known to date. Its host star is exceptionally active, showing a pronounced, regular pattern of optical variability caused by magnetic activity. The transiting hot Jupiter, CoRoT-2b, shows one of the largest known radius anomalies. We analyze the properties and activity of CoRoT-2a in the optical and X-ray regime by means of a high-quality UVES spectrum and a 15 ks Chandra exposure both obtained during planetary transits. The UVES data are analyzed using various complementary methods of high-resolution stellar spectroscopy. We characterize the photosphere of the host star by deriving accurate stellar parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and abundances. Signatures of stellar activity, Li abundance, and interstellar absorption are investigated to provide constraints on the age and distance of CoRoT-2. Furthermore, our UVES data confirm the presence of a late-type stellar companion to CoRoT-2a that is gravitationally bound to the system. The Chandra data provide a clear detection of coronal X-ray emission from CoRoT-2a, for which we obtain an X-ray luminosity of 1.9 × 1029 erg s-1. The potential stellar companion remains undetected in X-rays. Our results indicate that the distance to the CoRoT-2 system is ≈270 pc, and the most likely age lies between 100 and 300 Ma. Our X-ray observations show that the planet is immersed in an intense field of high-energy radiation. Surprisingly, CoRoT-2a's likely coeval stellar companion, which we find to be of late-K spectral type, remains X-ray dark. Yet, as a potential third body in the system, the companion could account for CoRoT-2b's slightly eccentric orbit.  Based on observations obtained with UVES at the ESO VLT Kueyen telescope (program ID 385.D-0426) and the Chandra X-ray Observatory (obs. ID 10989).},

	Abstract = {We present thermal mass loss calculations over evolutionary time scales for the investigation if the smallest transiting rocky exoplanets CoRoT-7b (~1.68REarth) and Kepler-10b (~1.416REarth) could be remnants of an initially more massive hydrogen-rich gas giant or a hot Neptune-class exoplanet. We apply a thermal mass loss formula which yields results that are comparable to hydrodynamic loss models. Our approach considers the effect of the Roche lobe, realistic heating efficiencies and a radius scaling law derived from observations of hot Jupiters. We study the influence of the mean planetary density on the thermal mass loss by placing hypothetical exoplanets with the characteristics of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus to the orbital location of CoRoT-7b at 0.017 AU and Kepler-10b at 0.01684 AU and assuming that these planets orbit a K- or G-type host star. Our findings indicate that hydrogen-rich gas giants within the mass domain of Saturn or Jupiter cannot thermally lose such an amount of mass that CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b would result in a rocky residue. Moreover, our calculations show that the present time mass of both rocky exoplanets can be neither a result of evaporation of a hydrogen envelope of a ``Hot Neptune'' nor a ``Hot Uranus''-class object. Depending on the initial density and mass, these planets most likely were always rocky planets which could lose a thin hydrogen envelope, but not cores of thermally evaporated initially much more massive and larger objects.},

	Abstract = {Context. Star activity makes the mass determination of CoRoT-7b and CoRoT 7c uncertain. Investigators of the CoRoT team proposed several solutions, but all but one of them are larger than the initial determinations of 4.8 $\pm$ 0.8 MEarth for CoRoT-7b and 8.4 $\pm$ 0.9 MEarth for CoRoT 7c.  Aims: This investigation uses the excellent HARPS radial velocity measurements of CoRoT-7 to redetermine the planet masses and to explore techniques for determining mass and orbital elements of planets discovered around active stars when the relative variation in the radial velocity due to the star activity cannot be considered as just noise and can exceed the variation due to the planets.  Methods: The main technique used here is a self-consistent version of the high-pass filter used by Queloz et al. (2009, A&A, 506, 303) in the first mass determination of CoRoT-7b and CoRoT-7c. The results are compared to those given by two alternative techniques: (1) the approach proposed by Hatzes et al. (2010, A&A, 520, A93) using only those nights in which two or three observations were done; (2) a pure Fourier analysis. In all cases, the eccentricities are taken equal to zero as indicated by the study of the tidal evolution of the system. The periods are also kept fixed at the values given by Queloz et al. Only the observations done in the time interval BJD 2 454 847 - 873 are used because they include many nights with multiple observations; otherwise, it is not possible to separate the effects of the rotation fourth harmonic (5.91 d = Prot/4) from the alias of the orbital period of CoRoT-7b (0.853585 d).  Results: The results of the various approaches are combined to give planet mass values 8.0 $\pm$ 1.2 MEarth for CoRoT-7b and 13.6 $\pm$ 1.4 MEarth for CoRoT 7c. An estimation of the variation of the radial velocity of the star due to its activity is also given.  Conclusions: The results obtained with three different approaches agree to give higher masses than those in previous determinations. From the existing internal structure models they indicate that CoRoT-7b is a much denser super-Earth. The bulk density is 11 $\pm$ 3.5 g cm-3, so CoRoT-7b may be rocky with a large iron core.},

@article{Leger:2011,
	Abstract = {The search for rocky exoplanets plays an important role in our quest for extra-terrestrial life. Here, we discuss the extreme physical properties possible for the first characterised rocky super-Earth, CoRoT-7b (Rpl = 1.58 $\pm$ 0.10 REarth, Mpl = 6.9 $\pm$ 1.2 MEarth). It is extremely close to its star (a = 0.0171 AU = 4.48 Rst), with its spin and orbital rotation likely synchronised. The comparison of its location in the (Mpl, Rpl) plane with the predictions of planetary models for different compositions points to an Earth-like composition, even if the error bars of the measured quantities and the partial degeneracy of the models prevent a definitive conclusion. The proximity to its star provides an additional constraint on the model. It implies a high extreme-UV flux and particle wind, and the corresponding efficient erosion of the planetary atmosphere especially for volatile species including water. Consequently, we make the working hypothesis that the planet is rocky with no volatiles in its atmosphere, and derive the physical properties that result. As a consequence, the atmosphere is made of rocky vapours with a very low pressure (P <= 1.5 Pa), no cloud can be sustained, and no thermalisation of the planet is expected. The dayside is very hot (2474 $\pm$ 71 K at the sub-stellar point) while the nightside is very cold (50-75 K). The sub-stellar point is as hot as the tungsten filament of an incandescent bulb, resulting in the melting and distillation of silicate rocks and the formation of a lava ocean. These possible features of CoRoT-7b could be common to many small and hot planets, including the recently discovered Kepler-10b. They define a new class of objects that we propose to name ``Lava-ocean planets''.},

	Abstract = {Context. The advent of space-borne missions such as CoRoT or Kepler providing photometric data has brought new possibilities for asteroseismology across the H-R diagram. Solar-like oscillations are now observed in many stars, including red giants and main-sequence stars.  Aims: Based on several hundred identified pulsating red giants, we aim to characterize their oscillation amplitudes and widths. These observables are compared with those of main-sequence stars in order to test trends and scaling laws for these parameters for main-sequence stars and red giants.  Methods: An automated fitting procedure is used to analyze several hundred Fourier spectra. For each star, a modeled spectrum is fitted to the observed oscillation spectrum, and mode parameters are derived.  Results: Amplitudes and widths of red-giant solar-like oscillations are estimated for several hundred modes of oscillation. Amplitudes are relatively high (several hundred ppm) and widths relatively small (very few tenths of a muHz).  Conclusions: Widths measured in main-sequence stars show a different variation with the effective temperature from red giants. A single scaling law is derived for mode amplitudes of red giants and main-sequence stars versus their luminosity to mass ratio. However, our results suggest that two regimes may also be compatible with the observations.

@article{Silva-Valio:2011,
	Abstract = {Context. CoRoT-2, the second planet-hosting star discovered by the CoRoT satellite, is a young and active star. A total of 77 transits were observed for this system over a period of 135 days.  Aims: Small modulations detected in the optical light curve of the planetary transits are used to study the position, size, intensity, and temporal evolution of the photospheric spots on the surface of the star that are occulted by the planetary disk.  Methods: We apply a spot model to these variations and create a spot map of the stellar surface of CoRoT-2 within the transit band for every transit. From these maps, we estimate the stellar rotation period and obtain the longitudes of the spots in a reference frame rotating with the star. Moreover, the spots temporal evolution is determined. This model achieves a spatial resolution of 2$\,^{\circ}$.  Results: Mapping of 392 spots vs. longitude indicates the presence of a region free of spots, close to the equator, which is reminiscent of the coronal holes observed on the Sun during periods of maximum activity. With this interpretation, the stellar rotation period within the transit latitudes of -14.6 $\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 10$\,^{\circ}$ is obtained from the auto-correlation function of the time-integrated spot flux deficit, which yields a rotation period of 4.48 days. With this period, the temporal evolution of the spot surface coverage in individual 20$\,^{\circ}$ longitude bins has periodicities ranging from 9 to 53 days with an average value of 31 $\pm$ 15 days. On the other hand, the longitude integrated spot flux, which is independent of the stellar rotation period, oscillates with a periodicity of 17.7 days, and its false-alarm probability is ~3%.  Conclusions: The rotation period of 4.48 days obtained here is shorter than the 4.54 days derived from the out-of-transit light modulation. Because the transit data sample a region close to the stellar equator while the period determined from out-of-transit data reflects the average rotation of the star, this is taken as an indication of a latitudinal differential rotation of about 3% or 0.042 rad/d.

	Abstract = {The CoRoT exoplanet science team announces the discovery of CoRoT-11b, a fairly massive hot-Jupiter transiting a V = 12.9 mag F6 dwarf star (M_* = 1.27$\pm$0.05 M&sun;, R_* = 1.37$\pm$0.03 R&sun;, Teff = 6440$\pm$120 K), with an orbital period of P = 2.994329$\pm$0.000011 days and semi-major axis a = 0.0436$\pm$0.005 AU. The detection of part of the radial velocity anomaly caused by the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect shows that the transit-like events detected by CoRoT are caused by a planet-sized transiting object in a prograde orbit. The relatively high projected rotational velocity of the star (v sin i = 40$\pm$5 km s-1) places CoRoT-11 among the most rapidly rotating planet host stars discovered so far. With a planetary mass of Mp = 2.33$\pm$0.34 MJup and radius Rp =1.43$\pm$0.03 RJup, the resulting mean density of CoRoT-11b (rhop = 0.99$\pm$0.15 g/cm3) can be explained with a model for an inflated hydrogen-planet with a solar composition and a high level of energy dissipation in its interior.  The CoRoT space mission, launched on 2006 December 27, has been developed and is operated by CNES, with the contribution of Austria, Belgium, Brazil, ESA (RSSD and Science Programme), Germany and Spain.},

@article{Claret:2011,
	Abstract = {Aims: The complex physics of close binary stars is made even more challenging by the proximity effects that affect it. Understanding the influence of these proximity effects is one of the most important tasks in theoretical stellar astrophysics. It is crucial to know how the specific intensity is distributed over the stellar disk for a correct modelling of the light curves of eclipsing binaries and planetary transits. To provide theoretical input for light curve modelling codes, we present new calculations of gravity- and limb-darkening coefficients for a wide range of effective temperatures, gravities, metallicities, and microturbulent velocities.  Methods: We computed limb-darkening coefficients for several atmosphere models, which cover the transmission curves of the Kepler, CoRoT, and Spitzer space missions as well as more widely used passbands (Str{\"o}mgren, Johnson-Cousins, Sloan). In addition to these computations, which were made adopting the least-square method, we also performed calculations for the bi-parametric approximations by adopting the flux conservation method to provide users with an additional tool to estimate the theoretical error bars. To facilitate the modelling of the effects of tidal and rotational distortions, we computed the gravity-darkening coefficients y(lambda) using the same models of stellar atmospheres as for the limb-darkening. Compared to previous work, a more general differential equation was used, which now takes into account local gravity variations and the effects of convection.  Results: The limb-darkening coefficients were computed with a higher numerical resolution (100 mu points instead of 15 or 17, as is often used in the ATLAS models), and five equations were used to describe the specific intensities (linear, quadratic, root-square, logarithmic, and a 4-coefficient law). Concerning the gravity-darkening coefficients, the influence of the local gravity on y(lambda) is shown as well as the effects of convection, which turn out to be very significant for cool stars. The results are tabulated for log g's ranging from 0.0 to 5.0, -5.0 <= log [M/H] <= +1, 2000 K <= Teff <= 50 000 K and for five values of the microturbulent velocity. ATLAS and PHOENIX plane-parallel atmosphere models were used for all computations.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery by the CoRoT space mission of a transiting brown dwarf orbiting a F7V star with an orbital period of 3.06 days. CoRoT-15b has a radius of 1.12+0.30-0.15 {R}_Jup and a mass of 63.3 $\pm$ 4.1 {M}_Jup, and is thus the second transiting companion lying in the theoretical mass domain of brown dwarfs. CoRoT-15b is either very young or inflated compared to standard evolution models, a situation similar to that of M-dwarf stars orbiting close to solar-type stars. Spectroscopic constraints and an analysis of the lightcurve imply a spin period in the range 2.9-3.1 days for the central star, which is compatible with a double-synchronisation of the system.  The CoRoT space mission, launched on December 27th 2006, has been developed and is operated by CNES, with the contribution of Austria, Belgium, Brazil, ESA (RSSD and Science Programme), Germany, and Spain.

	Abstract = {We announce the discovery of the transiting planet CoRoT-13b. Ground-based follow-up in CFHT and IAC80 confirmed CoRoT's observations. The mass of the planet was measured with the HARPS spectrograph and the properties of the host star were obtained analyzing HIRES spectra from the Keck telescope. It is a hot Jupiter-like planet with an orbital period of 4.04 days, 1.3 Jupiter masses, 0.9 Jupiter radii, and a density of 2.34 g cm-3. It orbits a G0V star with T_eff = 5 945 K, M* = 1.09 M&sun;, R_* = 1.01 R&sun;, solar metallicity, a lithium content of + 1.45 dex, and an estimated age of between 0.12 and 3.15 Gyr. The lithium abundance of the star is consistent with its effective temperature, activity level, and age range derived from the stellar analysis. The density of the planet is extreme for its mass, implies that heavy elements are present with a mass of between about 140 and 300 {M}⊕.  The CoRoT space mission, launched on December 27th 2006, has been developed and is operated by CNES, with the contribution of Austria, Belgium, Brazil, ESA (RSSD and Science Programme), Germany and Spain. Part of the observations were obtained at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research Council of Canada, the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France, and the University of Hawaii. Based on observations made with HARPS spectrograph on the 3.6-m European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere telescope at La Silla Observatory, Chile (ESO program 184.C-0639). Based on observations made with the IAC80 telescope operated on the island of Tenerife by the Instituto de Astrof{\'\i}sica de Canarias in the Spanish Observatorio del Teide. Part of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

	Abstract = {We measure secondary eclipses of the hot giant exoplanets CoRoT-1 at 3.6 and 4.5 mum, and CoRoT-2 at 3.6 mum, both using Warm Spitzer. We find that the Warm Spitzer mission is working very well for exoplanet science. For consistency of our analysis we also re-analyze archival cryogenic Spitzer data for secondary eclipses of CoRoT-2 at 4.5 and 8 mum. We compare the total data for both planets, including optical eclipse measurements by the CoRoT mission, and ground-based eclipse measurements at 2 mum, to existing models. Both planets exhibit stronger eclipses at 4.5 than at 3.6 mum, which is often indicative of an atmospheric temperature inversion. The spectrum of CoRoT-1 is best reproduced by a 2460 K blackbody, due either to a high altitude layer that strongly absorbs stellar irradiance, or an isothermal region in the planetary atmosphere. The spectrum of CoRoT-2 is unusual because the 8 mum contrast is anomalously low. Non-inverted atmospheres could potentially produce the CoRoT-2 spectrum if the planet exhibits line emission from CO at 4.5 mum, caused by tidal-induced mass loss. However, the viability of that hypothesis is questionable because the emitting region cannot be more than about 30% larger than the planet's transit radius, based on the ingress and egress times at eclipse. An alternative possibility to account for the spectrum of CoRoT-2 is an additional opacity source that acts strongly at wavelengths less than 5 mum, heating the upper atmosphere while allowing the deeper atmosphere seen at 8 mum to remain cooler. We obtain a similar result as Gillon et al. for the phase of the secondary eclipse of CoRoT-2, implying an eccentric orbit with e cos(omega) = -0.0030 $\pm$ 0.0004.},

@article{Guenther:2011,
	Abstract = {Context. The small radius and high density of CoRoT-7b implies that this transiting planet belongs to a different species than all transiting planets previously found. Current models suggest that this is the first transiting rocky planet found outside the solar system. Given that the planet orbits a solar-like star at a distance of only 4.5 R*, it is expected that material released from its surface may then form an exosphere.  Aims: We constrain the properties of the exosphere by observing the planet in- and out-of-transit. Detecting the exosphere of CoRoT-7b would for the first time allow us to study the material originating in the surface of a rocky extrasolar planet. We scan the entire optical spectrum for any lines originating from the planet, focusing particularly on spectral lines such as those detected in Mercury and Io in our solar system.  Methods: Since lines originating in the exosphere are expected to be narrow, we observed CoRoT-7b at high resolution with UVES on the VLT. By subtracting the two spectra from each other, we search for emission and absorption lines originating in the exosphere of CoRoT-7b.  Results: In the first step, we focus on Ca I, Ca II, and Na, because these lines have been detected in Mercury. Since the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the spectra is as high as 300, we derive firm upper limits for the flux-range between 1.6 × 10-18 and 3.2 × 10-18 W m-2. For CaO, we find an upper limit of 10-17 W m-2. We also search for emission lines originating in the plasma torus fed by volcanic activity and derive upper limits for these lines. In the whole spectrum we finally try to identify other lines originating in the planet.  Conclusions: Except for CaO, the upper limits derived correspond to 2-6 × 10-6 L*, demonstrating the capability of UVES to detect very weak lines. Our observations certainly exclude the extreme interpretations of data for CoRoT-7b, such as an exosphere that emits 2000 times as brightly as Mercury.

	Abstract = {Context. The CoRoT satellite has recently discovered a hot Jupiter that transits across the disc of a F9 main-sequence star called CoRoT-6 with a period of 8.886 days.  Aims: We model the photospheric activity of the star and use the maps of the active regions to study stellar differential rotation and the star-planet interaction.  Methods: We apply a maximum entropy spot model to fit the optical modulation as observed by CoRoT during a uninterrupted interval of ~ 140 days. Photospheric active regions are assumed to consist of spots and faculae in a fixed proportion with solar-like contrasts.  Results: Individual active regions have lifetimes up to 30-40 days. Most of them form and decay within five active longitudes whose different migration rates are attributed to the stellar differential rotation for which a lower limit of DeltaOmega/Omega = 0.12 $\pm$ 0.02 is obtained. Several active regions show a maximum of activity at a longitude lagging the subplanetary point by ~ 200$\,^{\circ}$ with the probability of a chance occurrence being smaller than 1 percent.  Conclusions: Our spot modelling indicates that the photospheric activity of CoRoT-6 could be partially modulated by some kind of star-planet magnetic interaction, while an interaction related to tides is highly unlikely because of the weakness of the tidal force.  Based on observations obtained with CoRoT, a space project operated by the French Space Agency, CNES, with partecipation of the Science Programme of ESA, ESTEC/RSSD, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Germany, and Spain.},

	Abstract = {The lightcurve of CoRoT-2 shows substantial rotational modulation and deformations of the planet's transit profiles caused by starspots. We consistently model the entire lightcurve, including both rotational modulation and transits, stretching over approximately 30 stellar rotations and 79 transits. The spot distribution and its evolution on the noneclipsed and eclipsed surface sections are presented and analyzed, making use of the high resolution achievable under the transit path. We measure the average surface brightness on the eclipsed section to be (5$\pm$1)% lower than on the noneclipsed section. Adopting a solar spot contrast, the spot coverage on the entire surface reaches up to 19% and a maximum of almost 40% on the eclipsed section. Features under the transit path, i.e. close to the equator, rotate with a period close to 4.55 days. Significantly higher rotation periods are found for features on the noneclipsed section indicating a differential rotation of DeltaOmega > 0.1. Spotted and unspotted regions in both surface sections concentrate on preferred longitudes separated by roughly 180$\,^{\circ}$.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We report the discovery of CoRoT-8b, a dense small Saturn-class exoplanet that orbits a K1 dwarf in 6.2 days, and we derive its orbital parameters, mass, and radius.  Methods: We analyzed two complementary data sets: the photometric transit curve of CoRoT-8b as measured by CoRoT and the radial velocity curve of CoRoT-8 as measured by the HARPS spectrometer.  Results: We find that CoRoT-8b is on a circular orbit with a semi-major axis of 0.063 $\pm$ 0.001 AU. It has a radius of 0.57 $\pm$ 0.02 RJ, a mass of 0.22 $\pm$ 0.03 MJ, and therefore a mean density of 1.6 $\pm$ 0.1 g cm-3.  Conclusions: With 67% of the size of Saturn and 72% of its mass, CoRoT-8b has a density comparable to that of Neptune (1.76 g cm-3). We estimate its content in heavy elements to be 47-63 {M}_⊕, and the mass of its hydrogen-helium envelope to be 7-23 {M}_⊕. At 0.063 AU, the thermal loss of hydrogen of CoRoT-8b should be no more than  0.1% over an assumed integrated lifetime of 3 Ga.  Observations made with SOPHIE spectrograph at Observatoire de Haute Provence, France (PNP.07B.MOUT), and the HARPS spectrograph at ESO La Silla Observatory (081.C-0388 and 083.C-0186). The CoRoT space mission, launched on December 27, 2006, has been developed and is operated by the CNES with the contribution of Austria, Belgium, Brasil, ESA, Germany, and Spain.Both data sets are available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/520/A66},

@article{Jackson:2010,
	Abstract = {CoRoT-7 b is the first confirmed rocky exoplanet, but, with an orbital semimajor axis of 0.0172 au, its origins may be unlike any rocky planet in our Solar system. In this study, we consider the roles of tidal evolution and evaporative mass loss in CoRoT-7 b's history, which together have modified the planet's mass and orbit. If CoRoT-7 b has always been a rocky body, evaporation may have driven off almost half its original mass, but the mass loss may depend sensitively on the extent of tidal decay of its orbit. As tides caused CoRoT-7 b's orbit to decay, they brought the planet closer to its host star, thereby enhancing the mass loss rate. Such a large mass loss also suggests the possibility that CoRoT-7 b began as a gas giant planet and had its original atmosphere completely evaporated. In this case, we find that CoRoT-7 b's original mass probably did not exceed 200 Earth masses (about two-third of a Jupiter mass). Tides raised on the host star by the planet may have significantly reduced the orbital semimajor axis, perhaps causing the planet to migrate through mean-motion resonances with the other planet in the system, CoRoT-7 c. The coupling between tidal evolution and mass loss may be important not only for CoRoT-7 b but also for other close-in exoplanets, and future studies of mass loss and orbital evolution may provide insight into the origin and fate of close-in planets, both rocky and gaseous.},

	Abstract = {Context. The space telescope CoRoT searches for transiting extrasolar planets by continuously monitoring the optical flux of thousands of stars in several fields of view.  Aims: We report the discovery of CoRoT-10b, a giant planet on a highly eccentric orbit (e = 0.53 $\pm$ 0.04) revolving in 13.24 days around a faint (V = 15.22) metal-rich K1V star.  Methods: We used CoRoT photometry, radial velocity observations taken with the HARPS spectrograph, and UVES spectra of the parent star to derive the orbital, stellar, and planetary parameters.  Results: We derive a radius of the planet of 0.97 $\pm$ 0.07 RJup and a mass of 2.75 $\pm$ 0.16 MJup. The bulk density, rhop = 3.70 $\pm$ 0.83 g cm-3, is ~2.8 that of Jupiter. The core of CoRoT-10b could contain up to 240 M_⊕ of heavy elements. Moving along its eccentric orbit, the planet experiences a 10.6-fold variation in insolation. Owing to the long circularisation time, taucirc > 7 Gyr, a resonant perturber is not required to excite and maintain the high eccentricity of CoRoT-10b.  The CoRoT space mission, launched on December 27th 2006, has been developed and is operated by CNES, with the contribution of Austria, Belgium, Brazil, ESA (RSSD and Science Programme), Germany and Spain.},

	Abstract = {Context. Accurate parameters of the host stars of exoplanets are needed for interpreting the new planetary systems. The CoRoT satellite recently discovered a transiting rocky planet with a density similar to the inner planets in our solar system, a so-called super Earth. The mass was determined using ground-based follow-up spectroscopy, which also revealed a second, non-transiting super Earth.  Aims: These planets are orbiting a relatively faint (mV = 11.7) G9V star called CoRoT-7. We wish to refine the determination of the physical properties of the host star, which are important for the interpretation of the properties of the planetary system.  Methods: We used high-quality spectra from HARPS at the ESO 3.6 m and UVES at the VLT 8.2 m. We used various methods to analyse the spectra using 1D LTE atmospheric models. From the analysis of Fe i and Fe ii lines we determined the effective temperature, surface gravity and microturbulence. We used the Balmer lines to constrain the effective temperature and pressure-sensitive Mg 1b and Ca lines to constrain the surface gravity. We analysed both single spectra and co-add spectra to identify systematic errors. We determine the projected rotational velocity and macroturbulence by fitting the line shapes of isolated lines. We finally determined an approximate absolute magnitude from the Wilson-Bappu effect.  Results: From the analysis of the three best spectra, we find Teff = 5250$\pm$60 K, log g = 4.47$\pm$0.05, [M/H] = +0.12$\pm$0.06, and v sin i = 1.1+1.0-0.5 km s-1. The chemical composition of 20 analysed elements is consistent with uniform scaling by the metallicity +0.12 dex. From the analysis of spectra of stars with well-known parameters with similar parameters to CoRoT-7 (the Sun and alpha Cen B) we demonstrate that our methods are robust within the claimed uncertainties. We compared the L/M ratio with isochrones to constrain the evolutionary status. Using the age estimate of 1.2-2.3 Gyr based on stellar activity, we determine the mass and radius 0.91$\pm$0.03 M&sun; and 0.82$\pm$0.04 R&sun;. With these updated constraints we fitted the CoRoT transit light curve for CoRoT-7b. The revised planet radius is slightly smaller, R = 1.58$\pm$0.10 R_oplus, and the density becomes slightly higher, rho = 7.2$\pm$1.8 g cm-3.  The CoRoT space mission, launched on December 27, 2006, has been developed and is being operated by CNES, with the contribution of Austria, Belgium, Brazil, ESA, The Research and Scientific Support Department of ESA, Germany and Spain.},

	Abstract = {Context. The CoRoT 5-month long observation runs provide us with the opportunity to analyze a large variety of red-giant stars and derive their fundamental parameters from their asteroseismic properties.  Aims: We perform an analysis of more than 4600 CoRoT light curves to extract as much information as possible. We take into account the characteristics of both the star sample and the method to ensure that our asteroseismic results are as unbiased as possible. We also study and compare the properties of red giants in two opposite regions of the Galaxy.  Methods: We analyze the time series using the envelope autocorrelation function to extract precise asteroseismic parameters with reliable error bars. We examine first the mean wide frequency separation of solar-like oscillations and the frequency of the maximum seismic amplitude, then the parameters of the excess power envelope. With the additional information of the effective temperature, we derive the stellar mass and radius.  Results: We identify more than 1800 red giants among the 4600 light curves and obtain accurate distributions of the stellar parameters for about 930 targets. We are able to reliably measure the mass and radius of several hundred red giants. We derive precise information about the stellar population distribution and the red clump. By comparing the stars observed in two different fields, we find that the stellar asteroseismic properties are globally similar, but that the characteristics are different for red-clump stars.  Conclusions: This study demonstrates the efficiency of statistical asteroseismology: validating scaling relations allows us to infer fundamental stellar parameters, derive precise information about red-giant evolution and interior structure, analyze and compare stellar populations from different fields.  The CoRoT space mission, launched on 2006 December 27, was developed and is operated by the CNES, with participation of the Science Programs of ESA, ESAs RSSD, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Germany and Spain.},

@article{Snellen:2010,
	Abstract = {We present our analysis of the red-channel CoRoT data of extrasolar planet CoRoT-2b. A deep secondary eclipse is detected at a level of 1.02 $\pm$ 0.20 × 10-4, which suggests that all of the planet-signal detected previously in white light by Alonso et al. (2009, A&A, 501, L23) originates from the red channel. CoRoT-2b is the coolest exoplanet that has been detected in the optical so far. In contrast to the other planets, its measured brightness temperature of 2170$\pm$55 K is significantly higher than its maximum hemisphere-averaged effective day-side temperature. However, it is not expected that a hot Jupiter radiates as a black body, and its thermal spectrum can deviate significantly from a Planck curve. We present models of the planet/star flux ratio as function of wavelength, which are calculated for a T/P profile in radiative and hydrostatic equilibrium, using a self-consistent atmosphere code. These are compared with the CoRoT detection, and with measurements at 4.5 and 8 mum from the Spitzer Space Telescope from Gillon et al. (2010, A&A, 511, A3). We estimate that reflected light contributes only at a 10-20% level to the total optical eclipse depth. The models allow for an ``extra absorber'' to be inserted at high altitude in the planet's atmosphere. This produces a thermal inversion layer, recently invoked to explain the photometric reversals and flux enhancements seen in some planets in the infrared. In the 0.5-1.5 mum wavelength range, the model-spectra of planets with an extra absorber at high altitude, are relatively suppressed in flux compared to those without such absorber. We therefore argue that, in contrast to the other exoplanets detected in the optical so far, CoRoT-2b may not exhibit a significant thermal inversion in its atmosphere, causing its optical brightness temperature to be boosted above its maximum effective day-side temperature.},

We describe and discuss the satellite observations as well as the complementary ground-based observations - photometric and spectroscopic - carried out to assess the planetary nature of the object and determine its specific physical parameters. The discovery reported here is a ``hot Jupiter'' planet in an 8.9d orbit, 18 stellar radii, or 0.08 AU, away from its primary star, which is a solar-type star (F9V) with an estimated age of 3.0 Gyr. The planet mass is close to 3 times that of Jupiter. The star has a metallicity of 0.2 dex lower than the Sun, and a relatively high 7Li abundance. While the light curve indicates a much higher level of activity than, e.g., the Sun, there is no sign of activity spectroscopically in e.g., the [Ca ii] H&K lines.

	Abstract = {We present the results of a ground-based search for the secondary eclipse of the 3.3 M Jup transiting planet CoRoT-2b. We performed near-infrared photometry using the LIRIS instrument on the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope, in the H and Ks filters. We monitored the star around two expected secondary eclipses in two nights under very good observing conditions. For the depth of the secondary eclipse, in the H band we found a 3sigma upper limit of 0.17%, whereas we detected a tentative eclipse with a depth of 0.16% $\pm$ 0.09% in the Ks band. These depths can be translated into brightness temperatures of TH < 2250 K and T_{K_s} = 1890^{+260}_{-350} K, which indicate an inefficient re-distribution of the incident stellar flux from the planet's day side to its night side. Our results are in agreement with the CoRoT optical measurement (Alonso et al.) and with Spitzer 4.5 and 8 mum results (Gillon et al.).  Based on observations obtained with the William Herschel Telescope, operated by the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes and situated on the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrof{\'\i}sica de Canarias in La Palma, Spain.},

	Abstract = {Context. As a planet eclipses its parent star, a dark spot on the surface of the star may be occulted, causing a detectable variation in the light curve.  Aims: We study these light curve variations during transits and infer the physical characteristics of the stellar spots.  Methods: A total of 77 consecutive transit light curves of CoRoT-2 were observed with a high temporal resolution of 32 s, corresponding to an uninterrupted period of 134 days. By analyzing small intensity variations in the transit light curves, it was possible to detect and characterize spots on the surface of the star. The model used simulates planetary transits and enables the inclusion of spots on the stellar surface with different sizes, intensities (i.e., temperatures), and positions. Fitting the data with this model, it is possible to infer the physical characteristics of the spots. Because what is observed is the stellar flux blocked by the spots, there is a degeneracy between the spot intensity and area, although the spot radius defines the shape and width of the signal in the light curve. The model allows up to 9 spots to be present on the stellar surface within the transit band.  Results: Before the modeling of the spots was performed, the planetary radius relative to the star radius was estimated by fitting the deepest transit to minimize the effect of spots. A slightly larger (3%) radius, 0.172 Rstar, resulted instead in the previously reported 0.1667 Rstar. The fitting of the transits yields spots, or spot groups, of sizes ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 planetary radius, Rp, with a mean of 0.46 $\pm$ 0.11 Rp (~ 100 000 km), resulting in a stellar area covered by spots within the transit latitudes of 10-20%. The intensity varied from 0.3 to 0.8 of the disk center intensity, Ic, with a mean of 0.55 $\pm$ 0.13 Ic, which can be converted to temperature by assuming black-body emission for both the photosphere and the spots. Considering an effective temperature of 5625 K for the stellar photosphere, the mean spot temperature is 4700 $\pm$ 300 K.  Conclusions: The spot model used here was able to estimate the physical characteristics of the spots on CoRoT-2, such as size and intensity. The spots on CoRoT-2 are larger and cooler than sunspots, maybe confirming the more active nature of this star with respect to the Sun. The results presented here are in agreement with those found for magnetic activity analysis from out of transit data of the same star.

	Abstract = {CoRoT-7b, a planet about 70% larger than the Earth orbiting a Sun-like star, is the first-discovered rocky exoplanet, and hence has been dubbed a "super-Earth." Some initial studies suggested that since the planet is so close to its host star, it receives enough insolation to partially melt its surface. However, these past studies failed to take into consideration the role that tides may play in this system. Even if the planet's eccentricity has always been zero, we show that tidal decay of the semimajor axis could have been large enough that the planet formed on a wider orbit which received less insolation. Moreover, CoRoT-7b could be tidally heated at a rate that dominates its geophysics and drives extreme volcanism. In this case, CoRoT-7b is a "super-Io" that, like Jupiter's volcanic moon, is dominated by volcanism and rapid resurfacing. Such heating could occur with an eccentricity of just 10-5. This small value could be driven by CoRoT-7c if its own eccentricity is larger than ~10-4. CoRoT-7b may be the first of a class of planetary super-Ios likely to be revealed by the CoRoT and Kepler spacecraft.},

@article{Kallinger:2010,
	Abstract = {Context. Observations and analysis of solar-type oscillations in red-giant stars is an emerging aspect of asteroseismic analysis with a number of open questions yet to be explored. Although stochastic oscillations have previously been detected in red giants from both radial velocity and photometric measurements, those data were either too short or had sampling that was not complete enough to perform a detailed data analysis of the variability. The quality and quantity of photometric data as provided by the CoRoT satellite is necessary to provide a breakthrough in observing p-mode oscillations in red giants. We have analyzed continuous photometric time-series of about 11 400 relatively faint stars obtained in the exofield of CoRoT during the first 150 days long-run campaign from May to October 2007. We find several hundred stars showing a clear power excess in a frequency and amplitude range expected for red-giant pulsators. In this paper we present first results on a sub-sample of these stars.  Aims: Knowing reliable fundamental parameters like mass and radius is essential for detailed asteroseismic studies of red-giant stars. As the CoRoT exofield targets are relatively faint (11-16 mag) there are no (or only weak) constraints on the stars' location in the H-R diagram. We therefore aim to extract information about such fundamental parameters solely from the available time series.  Methods: We model the convective background noise and the power excess hump due to pulsation with a global model fit and deduce reliable estimates for the stellar mass and radius from scaling relations for the frequency of maximum oscillation power and the characteristic frequency separation.  Results: We provide a simple method to estimate stellar masses and radii for stars exhibiting solar-type oscillations. Our method is tested on a number of known solar-type pulsators.  The CoRoT ( Convection, Rotation, and planetary Transits) space mission, launched on 2006 December 27, was developed and is operated by the CNES, with participation of the Science Programs of ESA, ESAs RSSD, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Germany and Spain.},

We present limb-darkening coefficients (LDCs) for the exoplanet hunting CoRot and Kepler missions. The LDCs are calculated with ATLAS stellar atmospheric model grids and span a wide range of Teff, log g, and metallically [M/H]. Both CoRot and Kepler use wide nonstandard photometric filters, and are producing a large inventory of high-quality transiting lightcurves, sensitive to stellar limb darkening. Comparing the stellar model limb darkening to results from the first seven CoRot planets, we find better fits are found when two model intensities at the limb are excluded in the coefficient calculations. This calculation method can help to avoid a major deficiency present at the limbs of the 1D stellar models.

	Abstract = {Aims: We report the discovery of very shallow (Delta F/F ≈ 3.4× 10-4), periodic dips in the light curve of an active V = 11.7 G9V star observed by the CoRoT satellite, which we interpret as caused by a transiting companion. We describe the 3-colour CoRoT data and complementary ground-based observations that support the planetary nature of the companion.  Methods: We used CoRoT colours information, good angular resolution ground-based photometric observations in- and out- of transit, adaptive optics imaging, near-infrared spectroscopy, and preliminary results from radial velocity measurements, to test the diluted eclipsing binary scenarios. The parameters of the host star were derived from optical spectra, which were then combined with the CoRoT light curve to derive parameters of the companion.  Results: We examined all conceivable cases of false positives carefully, and all the tests support the planetary hypothesis. Blends with separation >0.40´´or triple systems are almost excluded with a 8 × 10-4 risk left. We conclude that, inasmuch we have been exhaustive, we have discovered a planetary companion, named CoRoT-7b, for which we derive a period of 0.853 59 $\pm$ 3 × 10-5 day and a radius of Rp = 1.68 $\pm$ 0.09 R_Earth. Analysis of preliminary radial velocity data yields an upper limit of 21 M_Earth for the companion mass, supporting the finding.  Conclusions: CoRoT-7b is very likely the first Super-Earth with a measured radius. This object illustrates what will probably become a common situation with missions such as Kepler, namely the need to establish the planetary origin of transits in the absence of a firm radial velocity detection and mass measurement. The composition of CoRoT-7b remains loosely constrained without a precise mass. A very high surface temperature on its irradiated face, ≈1800-2600 K at the substellar point, and a very low one, ≈50 K, on its dark face assuming no atmosphere, have been derived.  The CoRoT space mission, launched on 27 December 2006, has been developed and is operated by CNES, with the contribution of Austria, Belgium, Brazil, ESA, Germany, and Spain. First CoRoT data are available to the public from the CoRoT archive: http://idoc-corot.ias.u-psud.fr. The complementary observations were obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by NRC in Canada, INSU-CNRS in France, and the University of Hawaii; ESO Telescopes at the La Silla and Paranal Observatories under programme ID 081.C-0413(C), DDT 282.C-5015; the IAC80 telescope operated by the Instituto de Astrof{\'\i}sica de Tenerife at the Observatorio del Teide; the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT), operated on the island of La Palma by the Isaac Newton group in the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de Los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias; and at the Anglo-Australian Telescope that have been funded by the Optical Infrared Coordination network (OPTICON), a major international collaboration supported by the Research Infrastructures Programme of the European Commissions Sixth Framework Programme; Radial-velocity observations were obtained with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the 1.93m telescope of Observatoire de Haute Provence, France.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We use extended planet formation models to analyse the results the two first runs of CoRoT, namely the initial one (IRa01) and the first long one (LRc01). We compare our calculations to the actual observations and discuss the possible origins of the differences between the two, not only in term of detection rate, but also regarding the magnitude of transiting planets parent stars.  Methods: We use a galactic population synthesis model in order to calculate the characteristics of stars in the field-of-view of CoRoT. In a second step, we calculate planet formation models to derive the population of planets expected around these stars. In a third step, using planet evolution models, we calculate the radius of planets predicted by the model and estimate the probability of transit detection and confirmation by radial-velocity follow-up.  Results: Our calculations show that the present day CoRoT detection rate, based only on IRa01 and LRc01, is a factor 5 lower than the one predicted assuming all target are dwarf stars. On the other hand, the two detection rates become similar if one assumes some contamination of CoRoT targets by giant stars, or some less optimistic determinations of the noise level, the limiting signal-to-noise ratio and radial velocity follow-up performances. However, in all the cases we have considered, the majority of transits are found around faint stars, in conflict with the actual CoRoT detections.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the surface structure of the planet host star CoRoT-2a using a consistent model for both the ``global'' (i.e., rotationally modulated) lightcurve and the transit lightcurves, using data provided by the CoRoT mission. After selecting a time interval covering two stellar rotations and six transits of the planetary companion CoRoT-2b, we have adopted a ``strip'' model of the surface to reproduce the photometric modulation inside and outside the transits simultaneously. Our reconstructions show that it is possible to achieve appropriate fits for the entire subinterval using a low-resolution surface model with 36 strips. The surface reconstructions indicate that the brightness on the eclipsed section of the stellar surface is (6$\pm$1)% lower than the average brightness of the remaining surface. This result suggests a concentration of stellar activity in a band around the stellar equator similar to the behavior observed on the Sun.},

	Abstract = {We present radial-velocity sequences acquired during three transits of the exoplanet HD 189733b and one transit of CoRoT-3b. We applied a combined Markov-chain Monte-Carlo analysis of spectroscopic and photometric data on these stars, to determine a full set of system parameters including the projected spin-orbit misalignment angle of HD 189733b to an unprecedented precision via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect: beta = 0.85 circ + 0.32 ~- 0.28. This small but non-zero inclination of the planetary orbit is important to understand the origin of the system. On CoRoT-3b, results seem to point towards a non-zero inclination as well with beta=37.6circ + 10.0 ~-22.3, but this remains marginal. Systematic effects due to non-Gaussian cross-correlation functions appear to be the main cause of significant residuals that prevent an accurate determination of the projected stellar rotation velocity V sin(I) for both stars.

	Abstract = {We present detailed structure and evolution calculations for the first transiting extrasolar planets discovered by the space-based CoRoT mission. Comparisons between theoretical and observed radii provide information on the internal composition of the CoRoT objects. We distinguish three different categories of planets emerging from these discoveries and from previous ground-based surveys: (i) planets explained by standard planetary models including irradiation; (ii) abnormally bloated planets; and (iii) massive objects belonging to the overlapping mass regime between planets and brown dwarfs. For the second category, we show that tidal heating can explain the relevant CoRoT objects, providing non-zero eccentricities. We stress that the usual assumption of a quick circularization of the orbit by tides, as usually done in transit light curve analysis, is not justified a priori, as suggested recently by Levrard et al. (2009), and that eccentricity analysis should be carefully redone for some observations. Finally, special attention is devoted to CoRoT-3b and to the identification of its very nature: giant planet or brown dwarf? The radius determination of this object confirms the theoretical mass-radius predictions for gaseous bodies in the substellar regime but, given the present observational uncertainties, does not allow an unambiguous identification of its very nature. This opens the avenue, however, to an observational identification of these two distinct astrophysical populations, brown dwarfs and giant planets, in their overlapping mass range, as done for the case of the 8 Jupiter-mass object Hat-P-2b. According to the presently published error bars for the radius determination and to our present theoretical description of planet structure and evolution, the high mean density of this object requires a substantial metal enrichment of the interior and is inconsistent at about the 2-sigma limit with the expected radius of a solar-metallicity brown dwarf. Within the aforementioned observational and theoretical determinations, this allows a clear identification of its planetary nature, suggesting that planets may form up to at least 8 Jupiter masses.},

@article{Queloz:2009,
	Abstract = {We report on an intensive observational campaign carried out with HARPS at the 3.6 m telescope at La Silla on the star CoRoT-7. Additional simultaneous photometric measurements carried out with the Euler Swiss telescope have demonstrated that the observed radial velocity variations are dominated by rotational modulation from cool spots on the stellar surface. Several approaches were used to extract the radial velocity signal of the planet(s) from the stellar activity signal. First, a simple pre-whitening procedure was employed to find and subsequently remove periodic signals from the complex frequency structure of the radial velocity data. The dominant frequency in the power spectrum was found at 23 days, which corresponds to the rotation period of CoRoT-7. The 0.8535 day period of CoRoT-7b planetary candidate was detected with an amplitude of 3.3 m s-1. Most other frequencies, some with amplitudes larger than the CoRoT-7b signal, are most likely associated with activity. A second approach used harmonic decomposition of the rotational period and up to the first three harmonics to filter out the activity signal from radial velocity variations caused by orbiting planets. After correcting the radial velocity data for activity, two periodic signals are detected: the CoRoT-7b transit period and a second one with a period of 3.69 days and an amplitude of 4 m s-1. This second signal was also found in the pre-whitening analysis. We attribute the second signal to a second, more remote planet CoRoT-7c . The orbital solution of both planets is compatible with circular orbits. The mass of CoRoT-7b is 4.8$\pm$0.8 (M⊕) and that of CoRoT-7c is 8.4$\pm$ 0.9 (M⊕), assuming both planets are on coplanar orbits. We also investigated the false positive scenario of a blend by a faint stellar binary, and this may be rejected by the stability of the bisector on a nightly scale. According to their masses both planets belong to the super-Earth planet category. The average density of CoRoT-7b is rho=5.6$\pm$ 1.3 g cm-3, similar to the Earth. The CoRoT-7 planetary system provides us with the first insight into the physical nature of short period super-Earth planets recently detected by radial velocity surveys. These planets may be denser than Neptune and therefore likely made of rocks like the Earth, or a mix of water ice and rocks.

	Abstract = {The transiting planet CoRoT-1b is thought to belong to the pM-class of planets, in which the thermal emission dominates in the optical wavelengths. We present a detection of its secondary eclipse in the CoRoT white channel data, whose response function goes from ~400 to ~1000 nm. We used two different filtering approaches, and several methods to evaluate the significance of a detection of the secondary eclipse. We detect a secondary eclipse centered within 20 min at the expected times for a circular orbit, with a depth of 0.016 $\pm$ 0.006%. The center of the eclipse is translated in a 1-sigma upper limit to the planet's eccentricity of e cosomega< 0.014. Under the assumption of a zero Bond Albedo and blackbody emission from the planet, it corresponds to a T_CoRoT = 2330+120-140 K. We provide the equilibrium temperatures of the planet as a function of the amount of reflected light. If the planet is in thermal equilibrium with the incident flux from the star, our results imply an inefficient transport mechanism of the flux from the day to the night sides.

@article{Southworth:2011,
	Abstract = {I calculate the physical properties of 32 transiting extrasolar planet and brown-dwarf systems from existing photometric observations and measured spectroscopic parameters. The systems studied include 15 observed by the CoRoT satellite, 10 by Kepler and five by the Deep Impact spacecraft. Inclusion of the objects studied in previous papers leads to a sample of 58 transiting systems with homogeneously measured properties. The Kepler data include observations from Quarter 2, and my analyses of several of the systems are the first to be based on short-cadence data from this satellite.
The light curves are modelled using the JKTEBOP code, with attention paid to the treatment of limb darkening, contaminating light, orbital eccentricity, correlated noise and numerical integration over long exposure times. The physical properties are derived from the light-curve parameters, spectroscopic characteristics of the host star and constraints from five sets of theoretical stellar model predictions. An alternative approach using a calibration from eclipsing binary star systems is explored and found to give comparable results whilst imposing a much smaller computational burden.

My results are in good agreement with published properties for most of the transiting systems, but discrepancies are identified for CoRoT-5, CoRoT-8, CoRoT-13, Kepler-5 and Kepler-7. Many of the error bars quoted in the literature are underestimated. Refined orbital ephemerides are given for CoRoT-8 and for the Kepler planets. Asteroseismic constraints on the density of the host stars are in good agreement with the photometric equivalents for HD 17156 and TrES-2, but not for HAT-P-7 and HAT-P-11.

Complete error budgets are generated for each transiting system, allowing identification of the observations best-suited to improve measurements of their physical properties. Whilst most systems would benefit from further photometry and spectroscopy, HD 17156, HD 80606, HAT-P-7 and TrES-2 are now extremely well characterized. HAT-P-11 is an exceptional candidate for studying starspots. The orbital ephemerides of some transiting systems are becoming uncertain and they should be re-observed in the near future.

The primary results from the current work and from previous papers in the series have been placed in an online catalogue, from where they can be obtained in a range of formats for reference and further study. TEPCat is available at},

	Abstract = {I present an homogeneous determination of the physical properties of 14 transiting extrasolar planetary systems for which good photometric and spectroscopic data are available. The input quantities for each system are the results of the light-curve analyses presented in PaperI, and published measurements of the stellar velocity amplitude, effective temperature and metal abundance. The physical properties are determined by interpolating within tabulated predictions from stellar theory to find the optimal match to these input data. Statistical uncertainties are found using a perturbation algorithm, which gives a detailed error budget for every output quantity. Systematic uncertainties are assessed for each quantity by comparing the values found using several independent sets of stellar models. As a theory-free alternative, physical properties are also calculated using an empirical mass-radius relation constructed from high-precision studies of low-mass eclipsing binary stars.
I find that the properties of the planets depend mostly on parameters measured from the light and radial velocity curves, and have a relatively minor sensitivity to theoretical predictions. In contrast, the orbital semimajor axes and stellar masses have a strong dependence on theoretical predictions, and their systematic uncertainties can be substantially larger than the statistical ones. Using the empirical mass-radius relation instead, the semimajor axes and stellar masses are smaller by up to 15 per cent. Thus, our understanding of extrasolar planets is currently limited by our lack of understanding of low-mass stars.

Using the properties of all known transiting extrasolar planets, I find that correlations between their orbital periods, masses and surface gravities are significant at the 2σ-3σ level. However, the separation of the known planets into two classes according to their Safronov number is weaker than previously found, and may not be statistically significant. Three systems, HAT-P-2, WASP-14 and XO-3, form their own little group of outliers, with eccentric orbits, massive planets and stars with masses ~1.3Msolar.

The detailed error budgets calculated for each system show where further observations are needed. XO-1 and WASP-1 could do with new transit light curves. TrES-2 and WASP-2 would benefit from more precise stellar temperature and abundance measurements. Velocity measurements of the parent stars are vital for determining the planetary masses: TrES-1, XO-1, WASP-1, WASP-2 and the OGLEs need additional data. The homogeneous analysis presented here is a step towards large-scale statistical studies of transiting extrasolar planetary systems, in preparation for the expected deluge of new detections from CoRoT and Kepler.},

	Abstract = {Determining the atmospheric structure and chemical composition of an exoplanet remains a formidable goal. Fortunately, advancements in the study of exoplanets and their atmospheres have come in the form of direct imaging---spatially resolving the planet from its parent star---which enables high-resolution spectroscopy of self-luminous planets in jovian-like orbits. Here, we present a spectrum with numerous, well-resolved molecular lines from both water and carbon monoxide from a massive planet orbiting less than 40 astronomical units from the star HR 8799. These data reveal the planet's chemical composition, atmospheric structure, and surface gravity, confirming that it is indeed a young planet. The spectral lines suggest an atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen ratio that is greater than that of the host star, providing hints about the planet's formation.},

As part of the Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler (HEK) project, we report a planetary system with two confirmed planets and one candidate planet discovered with the publicly available data for KOI-872. Planet b transits the host star with a period Pb = 33.6 days and exhibits large transit timing variations indicative of a perturber. Dynamical modeling uniquely detects an outer nontransiting planet c near the 5:3 resonance (Pc = 57.0 days) with a mass 0.37 times that of Jupiter. Transits of a third planetary candidate are also found: a 1.7-Earth radius super-Earth with a 6.8-day period. Our analysis indicates a system with nearly coplanar and circular orbits, reminiscent of the orderly arrangement within the solar system.},

	Abstract = {Context. The atmosphere of hot Jupiters can be probed by primary transit and secondary eclipse spectroscopy. Owing to the intense UV irradiation, mixing, and circulation, their chemical composition is maintained out of equilibrium and must be modeled with kinetic models.  Aims: Our purpose is to release a chemical network and the associated rate coefficients, developed for the temperature and pressure range relevant to hot Jupiters atmospheres. Using this network, we study the vertical atmospheric composition of the two hot Jupiters (HD 209458b and HD 189733b) with a model that includes photolyses and vertical mixing, and we produce synthetic spectra.  Methods: The chemical scheme has been derived from applied combustion models that were methodically validated over a range of temperatures and pressures typical of the atmospheric layers influencing the observations of hot Jupiters. We compared the predictions obtained from this scheme with equilibrium calculations, with different schemes available in the literature that contain N-bearing species, and with previously published photochemical models.  Results: Compared to other chemical schemes that were not subjected to the same systematic validation, we find significant differences whenever nonequilibrium processes take place (photodissociations or vertical mixing). The deviations from the equilibrium, hence the sensitivity to the network, are larger for HD 189733b, since we assume a cooler atmosphere than for HD 209458b. We found that the abundances of NH3 and HCN can vary by two orders of magnitude depending on the network, demonstrating the importance of comprehensive experimental validation. A spectral feature of NH3 at 10.5 mum is sensitive to these abundance variations and thus to the chemical scheme.  Conclusions: Due to the influence of the kinetics, we recommend using a validated scheme to model the chemistry of exoplanet atmospheres. The network we release is robust for temperatures within 300-2500 K and pressures from 10 mbar up to a few hundred bars, for species made of C, H, O, and N. It is validated for species up to 2 carbon atoms and for the main nitrogen species (NH3, HCN, N2, NOx). Although the influence of the kinetic scheme on the hot Jupiters spectra remains within the current observational error bars (with the exception of NH3), it will become more important for atmospheres that are cooler or subjected to higher UV fluxes, because they depart more from equilibrium.

	Abstract = {We investigate a population of transiting planets that receive relatively modest stellar insolation, indicating equilibrium temperatures <1000 K, and for which the heating mechanism that inflates hot Jupiters does not appear to be significantly active. We use structural evolution models to infer the amount of heavy elements within each of these planets. There is a correlation between the stellar metallicity and the mass of heavy elements in its transiting planet(s). It appears that all giant planets possess a minimum of ~10-15 Earth masses of heavy elements, with planets around metal-rich stars having larger heavy-element masses. There is also an inverse relationship between the mass of the planet and the metal enrichment (Z pl/Z star), which appears to have little dependency on the metallicity of the star. Saturn- and Jupiter-like enrichments above solar composition are a hallmark of all the gas giants in the sample, even planets of several Jupiter masses. These relationships provide an important constraint on planet formation and suggest large amounts of heavy elements within planetary H/He envelopes. We suggest that the observed correlation can soon also be applied to inflated planets, such that the interior heavy-element abundance of these planets could be estimated, yielding better constraints on their interior energy sources. We point to future directions for planetary population synthesis models and suggest future correlations. This appears to be the first evidence that extrasolar giant planets, as a class, are enhanced in heavy elements.},

	Abstract = {I derive the physical properties of 30 transiting extrasolar planetary systems using a homogeneous analysis of published data. The light curves are modelled with the JKTEBOP code, with special attention paid to the treatment of limb darkening, orbital eccentricity and error analysis. The light from some systems is contaminated by faint nearby stars, which if ignored will systematically bias the results. I show that it is not realistically possible to account for this using only transit light curves: light-curve solutions must be constrained by measurements of the amount of contaminating light. A contamination of 5 per cent is enough to make the measurement of a planetary radius 2 per cent too low.  The physical properties of the 30 transiting systems are obtained by interpolating in tabulated predictions from theoretical stellar models to find the best match to the light-curve parameters and the measured stellar velocity amplitude, temperature and metal abundance. Statistical errors are propagated by a perturbation analysis which constructs complete error budgets for each output parameter. These error budgets are used to compile a list of systems which would benefit from additional photometric or spectroscopic measurements.  The systematic errors arising from the inclusion of stellar models are assessed by using five independent sets of theoretical predictions for low-mass stars. This model dependence sets a lower limit on the accuracy of measurements of the physical properties of the systems, ranging from 1 per cent for the stellar mass to 0.6 per cent for the mass of the planet and 0.3 per cent for other quantities. The stellar density and the planetary surface gravity and equilibrium temperature are not affected by this model dependence. An external test on these systematic errors is performed by comparing the two discovery papers of the WASP-11/HAT-P-10 system: these two studies differ in their assessment of the ratio of the radii of the components and the effective temperature of the star.  I find that the correlations of planetary surface gravity and mass with orbital period have significance levels of only 3.1sigma and 2.3sigma, respectively. The significance of the latter has not increased with the addition of new data since Paper II. The division of planets into two classes based on Safronov number is increasingly blurred. Most of the objects studied here would benefit from improved photometric and spectroscopic observations, as well as improvements in our understanding of low-mass stars and their effective temperature scale.},

	Abstract = {I measure the physical properties of 38 transiting extrasolar planetary systems, bringing the total number studied within the Homogeneous Studies project to 82. Transit light curves are modelled using the JKTEBOP code, with careful attention paid to limb darkening, orbital eccentricity and contaminating light. The physical properties of each system are obtained from the photometric parameters, published spectroscopic measurements and five sets of theoretical stellar model predictions. Statistical errors are assessed using Monte Carlo and residual permutation algorithms and propagated via a perturbation algorithm. Systematic errors are estimated from the interagreement between results calculated using five theoretical stellar models.  The headline result is a major upward revision of the radius of the planet in the OGLE-TR-56 system, from 1.23-1.38 to 1.734 $\pm$ 0.051 $\pm$ 0.029 RJup (statistical and systematic errors, respectively). Its density is three times lower than previously thought. This change comes from the first complete analysis of published high-quality photometry. Significantly larger planetary radii are also found for Kepler-15, KOI-428, WASP-13, WASP-14 and WASP-21 compared to previous work.  I present the first results based on Kepler short-cadence data for Kepler-14, Kepler-15 and KOI-135. More extensive long-cadence data from the Kepler satellite are used to improve the measured properties of KOI-196, KOI-204, KOI-254, KOI-423 and KOI-428. The stellar component in the KOI-428 system is the largest known to host a transiting planet, at 2.48 $\pm$ 0.17 $\pm$ 0.20 R&sun;. Detailed analyses are given for HAT-P-3, HAT-P-6, HAT-P-9, HAT-P-14 and WASP-12, based on more extensive data sets than considered in previous studies.  Detailed analyses are also presented for the CoRoT systems 17, 18, 19, 20 and 23; Kepler-7, -12 and -17; KOI-254; OGLE-TR-111, -113, -132 and L9 and TrES-4.  I revisit the correlations between orbital period and surface gravity, and orbital period and mass of the transiting planets, finding both to be significant at the 4sigma level. I conclude by discussing the opportunities for follow-up observations, the sky positions and the discovery rate of the known transiting planets.},

@article{Southworth:2008,
	Abstract = {I present a homogeneous analysis of the transit light curves of 14 well-observed transiting extrasolar planets. The light curves are modelled using JKTEBOP, random errors are measured using Monte Carlo simulations and the effects of correlated noise are included using a residual-permutation algorithm. The importance of stellar limb darkening on the light-curve solutions and parameter uncertainties is investigated using five different limb darkening laws and including different numbers of coefficients as fitted parameters. The linear limb darkening law cannot adequately fit the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry of HD209458, but the other four laws give very similar results to each other for all transit light curves. In most cases fixing the limb darkening coefficients at theoretically predicted values does not bias the results, but does cause the error estimates to be too small. The available theoretical limb darkening coefficients clearly disagree with empirical values measured from the HST light curves of HD209458 limb darkening must be included as fitted parameters when analysing high-quality light curves.  In most cases the results of my analysis agree with the values found by other authors, but the uncertainties I find can be significantly larger (by factors of up to 3). Despite these greater uncertainty estimates, the analyses of sets of independent light curves for both HD189733 and HD209458 lead to results which do not agree with each other. This discrepancy is worst for the ratio of the radii (6.7sigma for HD189733 and 3.7sigma for HD209458), which depends primarily on the depth of the transit. It is therefore not due to the analysis method but is present in the light curves. These underlying systematic errors cannot be detected from the reduced data alone unless at least three independent light curves are available for an individual planetary system.  The surface gravities of transiting extrasolar planets are known to be correlated with their orbital periods. New surface gravity values, calculated from the light-curve results and the stellar spectroscopic orbits, show that this correlation is still present. New high-precision light curves are needed for HD149026, OGLE-TR-10, OGLE-TR-56, OGLE-TR-132 and GJ436, and new radial velocity curves for the XO-1, WASP-1, WASP-2 and the OGLE (Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment) planetary systems.},

	Abstract = {We show that the surface gravity of a transiting extrasolar planet can be calculated from only the spectroscopic orbit of its parent star and the analysis of its transit light curve. This does not require additional constraints, such as are often inferred from theoretical stellar models or model atmospheres. The surface gravity of the planet can therefore be measured precisely and from only directly observable quantities. We outline the method and apply it to the case of the first known transiting extrasolar planet, HD209458b. We find a surface gravity of gp = 9.28 +/- 0.15 m s-2, which is an order of magnitude more precise than the best available measurements of its mass, radius and density. This confirms that the planet has a much lower surface gravity than that predicted by published theoretical models of gas giant planets. We apply our method to all 14 known transiting extrasolar planets and find a significant correlation between surface gravity and orbital period, which is related to the known correlation between mass and period. This correlation may be the underlying effect as surface gravity is a fundamental parameter in the evaporation of planetary atmospheres.},

The system's period is short, P=2.230736+/-0.000010 days, with an orbit indistinguishable from circular, e=0.012+/-0.021. We demonstrate generally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined binary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the light curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique line in the mass-radius diagram, with M/R2 = constant. For HAT-TR-205-013, we assume the orbit has been tidally circularized and that the primary's rotation has been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed line broadening, Vrotsinirot=28.9+/-1.0 km s-1, gives a primary radius of RA=1.28+/-0.04 Rsolar. Our light-curve analysis leads to the radius of the secondary, RB=0.167+/-0.006 Rsolar, and the semimajor axis of the orbit, a=7.54+/-0.30 Rsolar=0.0351+/-0.0014 AU. Our single-lined spectroscopic orbit and the semimajor axis then yield the individual masses MB=0.124+/-0.010 Msolar and MA=1.04+/-0.13 Msolar. Our result for HAT-TR-205-013 B lies above the theoretical mass-radius models from the Lyon group, consistent with results from double-lined eclipsing binaries. The method we describe offers the opportunity to study the very low end of the stellar mass-radius relation.},

	Abstract = {The meteorology of hot Jupiters has been characterized primarily with thermal measurements, but recent observations suggest the possibility of directly detecting the winds by observing the Doppler shift of spectral lines seen during transit. Motivated by these observations, we show how Doppler measurements can place powerful constraints on the meteorology. We show that the atmospheric circulation---and Doppler signature---of hot Jupiters splits into two regimes. Under weak stellar insolation, the day-night thermal forcing generates fast zonal jet streams from the interaction of atmospheric waves with the mean flow. In this regime, air along the terminator (as seen during transit) flows toward Earth in some regions and away from Earth in others, leading to a Doppler signature exhibiting superposed blueshifted and redshifted components. Under intense stellar insolation, however, the strong thermal forcing damps these planetary-scale waves, inhibiting their ability to generate jets. Strong frictional drag likewise damps these waves and inhibits jet formation. As a result, this second regime exhibits a circulation dominated by high-altitude, day-to-night airflow, leading to a predominantly blueshifted Doppler signature during transit. We present state-of-the-art circulation models including non-gray radiative transfer to quantify this regime shift and the resulting Doppler signatures; these models suggest that cool planets like GJ 436b lie in the first regime, HD 189733b is transitional, while planets hotter than HD 209458b lie in the second regime. Moreover, we show how the amplitude of the Doppler shifts constrains the strength of frictional drag in the upper atmospheres of hot Jupiters. If due to winds, the ~2 km s-1 blueshift inferred on HD 209458b may require drag time constants as short as 104-106 s, possibly the result of Lorentz-force braking on this planet's hot dayside.},

	Abstract = {Three dimensional studies of convection in deep spherical shells have been used to test the hypothesis that the strong jet streams on Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune result from convection throughout the molecular envelopes. Due to computational limitations, these simulations must be performed at parameter settings far from jovian values and generally adopt heat fluxes 5-10 orders of magnitude larger than the planetary values. Several numerical investigations have identified trends for how the mean jet speed varies with heat flux and viscosity in these models, but no previous theories have been advanced to explain these trends. Here, we show using simple arguments that if convective release of potential energy pumps the jets and viscosity damps them, the mean jet speeds split into two regimes. When the convection is weakly nonlinear, the equilibrated jet speeds should scale approximately with F/nu, where F is the convective heat flux and nu is the viscosity. When the convection is strongly nonlinear, the jet speeds are faster and should scale approximately as (F/nu)1/2. We demonstrate how this regime shift can naturally result from a shift in the behavior of the jet-pumping efficiency with heat flux and viscosity. Moreover, both Boussinesq and anelastic simulations hint at the existence of a third regime where, at sufficiently high heat fluxes or sufficiently small viscosities, the jet speed becomes independent of the viscosity. We show based on mixing-length estimates that if such a regime exists, mean jet speeds should scale as heat flux to the 1/4 power. Our scalings provide a good match to the mean jet speeds obtained in previous Boussinesq and anelastic, three-dimensional simulations of convection within giant planets over a broad range of parameters. When extrapolated to the real heat fluxes, these scalings suggest that the mass-weighted jet speeds in the molecular envelopes of the giant planets are much weaker---by an order of magnitude or more---than the speeds measured at cloud level.},

@article{Showman:2011,
	Abstract = {The increasing richness of exoplanet observations has motivated a variety of three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric circulation models of these planets. Under strongly irradiated conditions, models of tidally locked, short-period planets (both hot Jupiters and terrestrial planets) tend to exhibit a circulation dominated by a fast eastward, or "superrotating," jet stream at the equator. When the radiative and advection timescales are comparable, this phenomenon can cause the hottest regions to be displaced eastward from the substellar point by tens of degrees longitude. Such an offset has been subsequently observed on HD 189733b, supporting the possibility of equatorial jets on short-period exoplanets. Despite its relevance, however, the dynamical mechanisms responsible for generating the equatorial superrotation in such models have not been identified. Here, we show that the equatorial jet results from the interaction of the mean flow with standing Rossby waves induced by the day-night thermal forcing. The strong longitudinal variations in radiative heating---namely intense dayside heating and nightside cooling---trigger the formation of standing, planetary-scale equatorial Rossby and Kelvin waves. The Rossby waves develop phase tilts that pump eastward momentum from high latitudes to the equator, thereby inducing equatorial superrotation. We present an analytic theory demonstrating this mechanism and explore its properties in a hierarchy of one-layer (shallow-water) calculations and fully 3D models. The wave-mean-flow interaction produces an equatorial jet whose latitudinal width is comparable to that of the Rossby waves, namely the equatorial Rossby deformation radius modified by radiative and frictional effects. For conditions typical of synchronously rotating hot Jupiters, this length is comparable to a planetary radius, explaining the broad scale of the equatorial jet obtained in most hot-Jupiter models. Our theory illuminates the dependence of the equatorial jet speed on forcing amplitude, strength of friction, and other parameters, as well as the conditions under which jets can form at all.},

@article{Leconte:2011a,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we quantify the systematic impact of the nonspherical shape of transiting planets caused by tidal forces and rotation on the observed transit depth. Such a departure from sphericity leads to a bias in the derivation of the transit radius from the light curve and affects the comparison with planet structure and evolution models, which assume spherical symmetry. As the tidally deformed planet projects its smallest cross section area during the transit, the measured effective radius is smaller than the one of the unperturbed spherical planet (which is the radius predicted by 1D evolution models). This effect can be corrected by calculating the theoretical shape of the observed planet. Using a variational method and a simple polytropic assumption for the gaseous planet structure, we derived simple analytical expressions for the ellipsoidal shape of a fluid object (star or planet) accounting for both tidal and rotational deformations. We determined the characteristic polytropic indexes that describe the structures of irradiated close-in planets within the mass range 0.3 MJ < Mp < 75 MJ, at different ages, by comparing polytropic models with the inner density profiles calculated with the full evolution code. Our calculations yield a 20% effect on the transit depth, i.e. a 10% decrease in the measured radius, for the extreme case of a 1 MJ planet orbiting a Sun-like star at 0.01 AU, and the effect can be greater for lower mass objects. For the closest planets detected so far ( ≲ 0.05 AU), the effect on the radius is of the order of 1 to 10%, by no means a negligible effect, enhancing the puzzling problem of the anomalously large bloated planets. These corrections must thus be taken into account for correctly determining the radius from the transit light curve and when comparing theoretical models with observations. Our analytical expressions can be easily used to calculate these corrections, caused by the nonspherical shape of the planet, on the observed transit depth and thus to derive the planet's real equilibrium radius, the one to be used when comparing models with observations. They can also be used to model ellipsoidal variations in the stellar flux now detected in the CoRoT and Kepler light curves. We also derive directly usable analytical expressions for the moment of inertia and the Love number (k2) of a fluid planet as a function of its mass and, in the case of significant rotation, for its oblateness.

	Abstract = {We present the consistent evolution of short-period exoplanets coupling the tidal and gravothermal evolution of the planet. Contrarily to previous similar studies, our calculations are based on the complete tidal evolution equations of the Hut (1981) model, valid at any order in eccentricity, obliquity and spin. We demonstrate both analytically and numerically that except if the system was formed with a nearly circular orbit (e ⪅ 0.2), consistently solving the complete tidal equations is mandatory to derive correct tidal evolution histories. We show that calculations based on tidal models truncated at 2nd order in eccentricity, as done in all previous studies, lead to quantitatively and sometimes even qualitatively erroneous tidal evolutions. As a consequence, tidal energy dissipation rates are severely underestimated in all these calculations and the characteristic timescales for the various orbital parameters evolutions can be wrong by up to three orders of magnitude. These discrepancies can by no means be justified by invoking the uncertainty in the tidal quality factors. Based on these complete, consistent calculations, we revisit the viability of the tidal heating hypothesis to explain the anomalously large radius of transiting giant planets. We show that even though tidal dissipation does provide a substantial contribution to the planet's heat budget and can explain some of the moderately bloated hot-Jupiters, this mechanism can not explain alone the properties of the most inflated objects, including HD 209 458 b. Indeed, solving the complete tidal equations shows that enhanced tidal dissipation and thus orbit circularization occur too early during the planet's evolution to provide enough extra energy at the present epoch. In that case either a third, so far undetected, low-mass companion must be present to keep exciting the eccentricity of the giant planet, or other mechanisms - stellar irradiation induced surface winds dissipating in the planet's tidal bulges and thus reaching the convective layers, inefficient flux transport by convection in the planet's interior - must be invoked, together with tidal dissipation, to provide all the pieces of the abnormally large exoplanet puzzle.},

	Abstract = {While conventional interior models for Jupiter and Saturn are based on the simplistic assumption of a solid core surrounded by a homogeneous gaseous envelope, we have derived new models with an inhomogeneous distribution of heavy elements within these planets. Such a compositional gradient hampers large-scale convection that turns into double-diffusive convection, yielding an inner thermal profile that departs from the traditionally assumed adiabatic interior and affecting these planets heat content and cooling history. To address this problem, we have developed an analytical approach to describe layered double-diffusive convection and apply this formalism to solar system gaseous giant planet interiors. These models satisfy all observational constraints and yield values for the metal enrichment of our gaseous giants that are up to 30% to 60% higher than previously thought. The models also constrain the size of the convective layers within the planets. Because the heavy elements tend to be redistributed within the gaseous envelope, the models predict smaller than usual central cores inside Saturn and Jupiter, with possibly no core for the latter. These models open a new window and raise new challenges to our understanding of the internal structure of giant (solar and extrasolar) planets, in particular on how to determine their heavy material content, a key diagnostic for planet formation theories.},

	Abstract = {We present a simple statistical analysis of recent numerical simulations exploring the correlation between the core mass function (CMF) obtained from the fragmentation of a molecular cloud and the stellar mass function which forms from these collapsing cores. Our analysis shows that the distributions of bound cores and sink particles obtained in the simulations are consistent with the sinks being formed predominantly from their parent core mass reservoir, with a statistical dispersion of the order of one-third of the core mass. Such a characteristic dispersion suggests that the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is relatively tightly correlated to the parent CMF, leading to two similar distributions, as observed. This in turn argues in favor of the IMF being essentially determined at the early stages of core formation and being only weakly affected by the various environmental factors beyond the initial core mass reservoir, at least in the mass range explored in the present study. Accordingly, the final IMF of a star-forming region should be determined reasonably accurately, statistically speaking, from the initial CMF, provided some uniform efficiency factor. The calculations also show that these statistical fluctuations, due to, e.g., variations among the core properties, broaden the low-mass tail of the IMF compared with the parent CMF, providing an explanation for the fact that the latter appears to underestimate the number of "pre brown dwarf" cores compared with the observationally derived brown dwarf IMF.},

	Abstract = {Context: We examine the evolution of low-mass star and brown dwarf eclipsing binaries. These objects are rapid rotators and are believed to shelter large magnetic fields.  Aims: We suggest that reduced convective efficiency, due to fast rotation and large field strengths, and/or to magnetic spot coverage of the radiating surface significantly affect their evolution, leading to a reduced heat flux and thus larger radii and cooler effective temperatures than for regular objects.  Methods: We have considered such processes in our evolutionary calculations, using a phenomenological approach.  Results: This yields mass-radius and effective temperature-radius relationships in agreement with the observations. We also reproduce the effective temperature ratio and the radii of the two components of the recently discovered puzzling eclipsing brown dwarf system.  Conclusions: These calculations show that fast rotation and/or magnetic activity may significantly affect the evolution of eclipsing binaries and that the mechanical and thermal properties of these objects depart from the ones of non-active low-mass objects. We find that, for internal field strengths compatible with the observed surface value of a few kiloGauss, convection can be severely inhibited. The onset of a central radiative zone for rapidly rotating active low-mass stars might thus occur below the usual ~0.35 M_&sun; limit.},

	Abstract = {We explore the possibility that large-scale convection is inhibited over some regions of giant planet interiors, as a consequence of a gradient of composition inherited from either their formation history or particular events like giant impacts or core erosion during their evolution. Under appropriate circumstances, the redistribution of the gradient of molecular weight can lead to double diffusive layered or overstable convection. This leads to much less efficient heat transport and compositional mixing than large-scale adiabatic convection. We show that this process can explain the abnormally large radius of the transit planet HD 209458b and similar objects and may be at play in some giant planets, with short-period planets offering the most favorable conditions. Observational signatures of this transport mechanism are a large radius and a reduced heat flux output compared with uniformly mixed objects. If our suggestion is correct, it bears major consequences on our understanding of giant planet formation, structure and evolution, including possibly our own Jovian planets.},

	Abstract = {Extending the theory that we derived recently for HD 209458b to different cases of strongly irradiated gaseous exoplanets, we have calculated the consistent evolution of a new transiting planet, OGLE-TR-56b, for its recently revised mass determination. The theory is shown to successfully reproduce the observed radius for the proper age of the system. We also examine the dissipation of kinetic energy at the planet's internal adiabat due to atmospheric winds and place constraints on the efficiency of this process. We show that a fraction ~0.1%-0.5% of the incident flux transformed into thermal energy deposited at the adiabatic level can accommodate the observed radii of both OGLE-TR-56b and HD 209458b. The present theory yields quantitative predictions on the evolution of the emergent spectrum and fundamental properties of hot jupiters. The predictions for radius, luminosity, temperature as a function of the planet's mass, and orbital distance can be used as benchmarks for future detections of transit planets.},

@article{Chabrier:2003,
	Abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m>~1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc~0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass sigma~0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc~0.2 Msolar and sigma~0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD~n*~0.1 pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages >~130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc~0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below ~1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.  These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.

	Abstract = {In this paper, we extend the calculations conducted previously in the stellar regime to determine the brown dwarf initial mass function in the Galactic disk. We perform Monte Carlo calculations taking into account the brown dwarf formation rate, spatial distribution, and binary fraction. Comparison with existing surveys seems to exclude a power-law mass function as steep as the one determined in the stellar regime below 1 Msolar, i.e., dn/dm~m-1.5, and tends to favor a more flattish behavior. Although a power-law mass function in the substellar regime cannot be excluded by present-day observational constraints, a form dn/dm~m-1, i.e., dn/dlogm=constant, seems to be an upper limit. Comparison with methane dwarf detections tends to favor an eventually decreasing form like the lognormal or the more general exponential distributions determined in the previous paper. We calculate predicting brown dwarf counts in near-infrared color diagrams and brown dwarf discovery functions for various types of mass functions and formation rates and for different binary distributions. Based on these diagnostics, future large deep-field surveys should be able to determine more precisely the brown dwarf mass function and to provide information about the formation of starlike objects-stars and brown dwarfs-along the Galactic history. These calculations yield the presently most accurate determination of the brown dwarf census in the Galactic disk. The brown dwarf number density is comparable to the stellar one, nBD~=n*~=0.1 pc-3, showing that the star formation process in the disk extends well into the substellar regime. The corresponding brown dwarf mass density, however, represents only about 10% of the stellar contribution; i.e., rhoBD<~5.0×10-3Msolarpc- 3. Adding up the local stellar density determined in the previous paper, we obtain the density of starlike objects, stars and brown dwarfs, in the solar neighborhood, rhosolar~5.0×10-2Msolarpc- 3.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we use the general theory worked out within the past few years for the structure and the evolution of low-mass stars to derive the stellar mass function in the Galactic disk down to the vicinity of the hydrogen-burning limit from the observed nearby luminosity functions. The accuracy of the mass-magnitude relationships derived from the aforementioned theory is examined by comparison with recent, accurate observational relationships in the M-dwarf domain. The mass function is shown to flatten out below ~1 Msolar but to keep rising down to the bottom of the main sequence. Combining the present determination below 1 Msolar and J. M. Scalo's mass function for larger masses, we show that the mass function is well described over the entire stellar mass range, from ~100 Msolar to ~0.1 Msolar, by three functional forms, namely, a two-segment power law, a lognormal form, or an exponential form, all normalized to the Hipparcos sample at 0.8 Msolar. Integration of this mass function yields a reasonably accurate census of the entire stellar population in the Galactic disk and its volume and surface mass density.},

	Abstract = {We present new cooling sequences, color-magnitude diagrams, and color-color diagrams for cool white dwarfs with pure hydrogen atmospheres down to an effective temperature Teff=1500 K. We include a more detailed treatment of the physics of the fully ionized interior, particularly an improved discussion of the thermodynamics of the temperature-dependent ion-ion and ion-electron contributions of the quantum, relativistic electron-ion plasma. The present calculations also incorporate accurate boundary conditions between the degenerate core and the outermost layers as well as updated atmosphere models including the H2-H2 induced-dipole absorption. We examine the differences on the cooling time of the star arising from uncertainties in the initial carbon-oxygen profile and the core-envelope L-Tc relation. The maximum time delay due to crystallization-induced chemical fractionation remains substantial, from ~1.0 Gyr for 0.5 and 1.2 Msolar white dwarfs to ~1.5 Gyr for 0.6-0.8 Msolar white dwarfs, even with initial stratified composition profiles, and cannot be ignored in detailed white dwarf cooling calculations. These cooling sequences provide theoretical support to search for or identify old disk or halo hydrogen-rich white dwarfs by characterizing their mass and age from their observational signatures.},

	Abstract = {Since the discovery of the first bona-fide brown dwarfs and extra-solar planets in 1995, the field of low-mass stars and substellar objects has progressed considerably, both from theoretical and observational viewpoints. Recent developments in the physics entering the modeling of these objects have led to significant improvements in the theory and to a better understanding of these objects' mechanical and thermal properties. This theory can now be confronted with observations directly in various observational diagrams (color-color, color-magnitude, mass-magnitude, mass-spectral type), a stringent and unavoidable constraint that became possible only recently with the generation of synthetic spectra. In this paper we present the current state-of-the-art general theory of low-mass stars and sub stellar objects, from one solar mass to one Jupiter mass, regarding primarily their interior structure and evolution. This review is a natural complement to the previous review by Allard et al (1997) on the atmosphere of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Special attention is devoted to the comparison of the theory with various available observations. The contribution of low-mass stellar and sub stellar objects to the Galactic mass budget is also analyzed.},

We characterize potential spectroscopic signatures of deuterium in the lines of deuterated water HDO. These results will serve as a useful, independent diagnostic to characterize the mass and/or the age of young substellar objects and to provide an independent age determination of very young clusters. These results can serve to identify objects at the deuterium-burning limit and to confront the theoretical prediction that D burning is a necessary condition to form starlike objects.},

	Abstract = {We present evolutionary calculations for very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs based on synthetic spectra and nongray atmosphere models which include dust formation and opacity, i.e., objects with Teff<~2800 K. The interior of the most massive brown dwarfs is shown to develop a conductive core after ~2 Gyr which slows down their cooling. Comparison is made in optical and infrared color-magnitude diagrams with recent late-M and L dwarf observations. The saturation in optical colors and the very red near-infrared colors of these objects are well explained by the onset of dust formation in the atmosphere. Comparison of the faintest presently observed L dwarfs with these dusty evolutionary models suggests that dynamical processes such as turbulent diffusion and gravitational settling are taking place near the photosphere. As the effective temperature decreases below Teff~1300-1400 K, the colors of these objects move to very blue near-infrared colors, a consequence of the ongoing methane absorption in the infrared. We suggest the possibility of a brown dwarf dearth in J, H, and K color-magnitude diagrams around this temperature.},

The calculations are based on the linear-response theory for the electron-ion interaction, including the local-field corrections in the electronic dielectric function. The thermodynamic quantities are calculated in the framework of the N-body hypernetted-chain equations and fitted by analytic expressions. We present also accurate analytic approximations for the free energy of the ideal electron gas at arbitrary degeneracy and relativity and for the excess free energy of the one-component plasma of ions derived from Monte Carlo simulations. The extension to multi-ionic mixtures is discussed within the framework of the linear mixing rule. These formulas provide a completely analytic, accurate description of the thermodynamic quantities of fully ionized electron-ion Coulomb plasmas, a useful tool for various applications from liquid state theory to dense stellar matter.},

We examine the evolution of the different mechanical and thermal properties of these objects as a function of mass and metallicity. We also demonstrate the inaccuracy of grey models and T(tau ) relationships under these conditions. We provide detailed tables of the mass-radius-luminosity-effective temperature relations for various ages and metallicities, aimed at calibrating existing or future observations of low-mass stars and massive brown dwarfs. We derive new hydrogen-burning minimum masses, within the afore-mentioned metallicity range. These minimum masses are found to be smaller than previous estimates, a direct consequence of non-grey effects. At last, we examine the evolution of the abundance of light elements, Li, Be and B, as a function of age, mass and metallicity.

	Abstract = {We derive mass-luminosity relationships for very low mass stars (0.06 < m/M&sun; < 0.6) for different metallicities. Calculations are conducted with the different nongray atmosphere models presently available to illustrate the uncertainties in the stellar models. The theoretical mass-magnitude relation reproduces accurately the observed relationship in the V band (Henry & McCarthy) but still underestimates the flux in the K band by ~0.5 mag, a consequence of the still inaccurate water opacities. Calculations based on the gray approximation are shown to yield incorrect results over the entire mass range of interest. We also show that the fate of objects near the hydrogen-burning limit depends significantly on the treatment of the atmosphere. Nongray effects yield cooler and less luminous objects for a given mass near the stellar/substellar transition, and thus a lower hydrogen-burning minimum mass, m ~ 0.07 M&sun;, for solar metallicity. The depletion of lithium along evolution is considered in detail, and we give age versus lithium-abundance relations that provide useful guides to determine the mass and the age of spectroscopically observed low-mass objects.},

@article{Baraffe:2010a,
	Abstract = {Following up our recent analysis devoted to the impact of non steady accretion on the location of young low-mass stars or brown dwarfs in the Herzsprung-Russell diagram, we perform a detailed analysis devoted to the effect of burst accretion on the internal structure of low-mass and solar type stars. We find that episodic accretion can produce objects with significantly higher central temperatures than the ones of the non accreting counterparts of same mass and age. As a consequence, lithium depletion can be severely enhanced in these objects. This provides a natural explanation for the unexpected level of lithium depletion observed in young objects for the inferred age of their parent cluster. These results confirm the limited reliability of lithium abundance as a criterion for assessing or rejecting cluster membership. They also show that lithium is not a reliable age indicator, because its fate strongly depends on the past accretion history of the star. Under the assumption that giant planets primarily form in massive disks prone to gravitational instability and thus to accretion burst episodes, the same analysis also explains the higher Li depletion observed in planet hosting stars. At last, we show that, depending on the burst rate and intensity, accretion outbursts can produce solar mass stars with lower convective envelope masses, at ages less than a few tens of Myr, than predicted by standard (non or slowly accreting) pre-main sequence models. This result has interesting, although speculative, implications for the recently discovered depletion of refractory elements in the Sun.},

@article{Baraffe:2008,
	Abstract = {Aims: We examine the uncertainties in current planetary models and quantify their impact on the planet cooling histories and mass-radius relationships.   Methods: These uncertainties include (i) the differences between the various equations of state used to characterize the heavy material thermodynamical properties, (ii) the distribution of heavy elements within planetary interiors, (iii) their chemical composition, and (iv) their thermal contribution to the planet evolution. Our models, which include a gaseous H/He envelope, are compared with models of solid, gasless Earth-like planets in order to examine the impact of a gaseous envelope on the cooling and the resulting radius.  Results: We find that, for a fraction of heavy material larger than 20% of the planet mass, the distribution of the heavy elements in the planet's interior substantially affects the evolution and thus the radius at a given age. For planets with large core mass fractions (⪆50%), such as the Neptune-mass transiting planet GJ 436b, the contribution of the gravitational and thermal energy from the core to the planet cooling history is not negligible, yielding a  10% effect on the radius after 1 Gyr. We show that the present mass and radius determinations of the massive planet Hat-P-2b require at least 200 {M}_⊕ of heavy material in the interior, at the edge of what is currently predicted by the core-accretion model for planet formation. As an alternative avenue for massive planet formation, we suggest that this planet, and similarly HD 17156b, may have formed from collisions between one or several other massive planets. This would explain these planets unusually high density and high eccentricity. We show that if planets as massive as  25 MJ can form, as predicted by improved core-accretion models, deuterium is able to burn in the H/He layers above the core, even for core masses as high as  100 {M}_⊕. Such a result highlights the confusion provided by a definition of a planet based on the deuterium-burning limit. Conclusions: We provide extensive grids of planetary evolution models from 10 {M}_⊕ to 10 M_Jup, with various fractions of heavy elements. These models provide a reference for analyzing the transit discoveries expected from the CoRoT and Kepler missions and for inferring the internal composition of these objects.},

	Abstract = {Tremendous progress in the science of extrasolar planets has been achieved since the discovery of a Jupiter orbiting the nearby Sun-like star 51 Pegasi in 1995. Theoretical models have now reached enough maturity to predict the characteristic properties of these new worlds, mass, radius, atmospheric signatures, and can be confronted with available observations. We review our current knowledge of the physical properties of exoplanets, internal structure and composition, atmospheric signatures, including expected biosignatures for exo-Earth planets, evolution, and the impact of tidal interaction and stellar irradiation on these properties for the short-period planets. We discuss the most recent theoretical achievements in the field and the still pending questions. We critically analyze the different solutions suggested to explain abnormally large radii of a significant fraction of transiting exoplanets. Special attention is devoted to the recently discovered transiting objects in the overlapping mass range between massive planets and low-mass brown dwarfs, stressing the ambiguous nature of these bodies, and we discuss the possible observable diagnostics to identify these two distinct populations. We also review our present understanding of planet formation and critically examine the different suggested formation mechanisms. We expect this review will provide the basic theoretical background to capture the essentials of the physics of exoplanet formation, structure and evolution and the related observable signatures.},

@article{Baraffe:2009,
	Abstract = {We present evolutionary models for young low-mass stars and brown dwarfs taking into account episodic phases of accretion at early stages of the evolution, a scenario supported by recent large surveys of embedded protostars. An evolution including short episodes of vigorous accretion (\dot{M}>= 10^{-4} M_&sun; yr^{-1}) followed by longer quiescent phases (\dot{M}< 10^{-6} M_&sun; yr^{-1}) can explain the observed luminosity spread in H-R diagrams of star-forming regions at ages of a few Myr, for objects ranging from a few Jupiter masses to a few tenths of a solar mass. The gravitational contraction of these accreting objects strongly departs from the standard Hayashi track at constant T eff. The best agreement with the observed luminosity scatter is obtained if most of the accretion shock energy is radiated away. The obtained luminosity spread at 1 Myr in the H-R diagram is equivalent to what can be misinterpreted as an ~10 Myr age spread for non-accreting objects. We also predict a significant spread in radius at a given T eff, as suggested by recent observations. These calculations bear important consequences for our understanding of star formation and early stages of evolution and on the determination of the initial mass function for young (<= a few Myr) clusters. Our results also show that the concept of a stellar birthline for low-mass objects has no valid support.},

@article{Baraffe:2006,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a consistent description of the formation and the subsequent evolution of gaseous planets, with special attention to short-period, low-mass hot-Neptune planets characteristic of mu Ara-like systems. We show that core accretion, including migration and disk evolution, and subsequent evolution, taking irradiation and evaporation into account, provides a viable formation mechanism for this type of strongly irradiated light planets. At an orbital distance a ~= 0.1 AU, this revised core accretion model leads to the formation of planets with total masses ranging from ~14 M⊕ (0.044 M_J) to ~400 M⊕ (1.25 M_J). The newly born planets have a dense core of ~6 M⊕, independent of the total mass, and heavy element enrichments in the envelope, M_Z,env/M_env , varying from 10% to 80% from the largest to the smallest planets. We examine the dependence of the evolution of the born planet on the evaporation rate due to the incident XUV stellar flux. In order to reach a mu Ara-like mass (~14 M⊕) after ˜ 1 Gyr, the initial planet mass must range from 166 M⊕ (~0.52 M_J) to about 20 M⊕, for evaporation rates varying by 2 orders of magnitude, which corresponds to 90% to 20% mass loss during evolution. The presence of a core and heavy elements in the envelope affects the structure and the evolution of the planet appreciably and yields ˜ 8%-9% difference in radius compared to coreless objects of solar composition for Saturn-mass planets. These combinations of evaporation rates and internal compositions translate into different detection probabilities and thus into different statistical distributions for hot-Neptunes and hot-Jupiters. These calculations provide an observable diagnostic, namely a mass-radius-age relationship to distinguish between the present core-accretion-evaporation model and the alternative colliding core scenario for the formation of hot-Neptunes.},

	Abstract = {We compare evolutionary models for close-in exoplanets coupling irradiation and evaporation due respectively to the thermal and high energy flux of the parent star with observations of recently discovered new transiting planets. The models provide an overall good agreement with observations, although at the very limit of the quoted error bars of OGLE-TR-10, depending on its age. Using the same general theory, we show that the three recently detected hot-Neptune planets (GJ436, rho Cancri, mu Ara) may originate from more massive gas giants which have undergone significant evaporation. We thus suggest that hot-Neptunes and hot-Jupiters may share the same origin and evolution history. Our scenario provides testable predictions in terms of the mass-radius relationships of these hot-Neptunes.},

	Abstract = {We present evolutionary models for cool brown dwarfs and extra-solar giant planets. The models reproduce the main trends of observed methane dwarfs in near-IR color-magnitude diagrams. We also present evolutionary models for irradiated planets, coupling for the first time irradiated atmosphere profiles and inner structures. We focus on HD 209458-like systems and show that irradiation effects can substantially affect the radius of sub-jovian mass giant planets. Irradiation effects, however, cannot alone explain the large observed radius of HD 209458b. Adopting assumptions which optimise irradiation effects and taking into account the extension of the outer atmospheric layers, we still find  ~ 20% discrepancy between observed and theoretical radii. An extra source of energy seems to be required to explain the observed value of the first transit planet.},

	Abstract = {The understanding of the structure and evolution of our solar system giant planets has significantly advanced within the past years. Important progress is due not only to direct observations and in situ measurements, but also to high pressure laboratory experiments which test the properties of hydrogen under the same conditions of pressure and density as in the interior of giant planets. The modelling of giant planets has also improved due to theoretical and observational activities devoted to another type of objects, the brown dwarfs, closely related to giant planets in terms of atmospheric and thermodynamic properties. Since the best constraints are now available for Jupiter and Saturn, this review summarizes the latest improvements regarding the description of the interior and atmosphere of these two giant planets. We will also extend the discussion to extrasolar giant planets.},

	Abstract = {We include the effect of evaporation in our evolutionary calculations of close-in giant planets, based on a recent model for thermal evaporation taking into account the XUV flux of the parent star (Lammer et al. \cite{Lammer2003}). Our analysis leads to the existence of a critical mass for a given orbital distance mcrit(a) below which the evaporation timescale becomes shorter than the thermal timescale of the planet. For planets with initial masses below mcrit, evaporation leads to a rapid expansion of the outer layers and of the total planetary radius, speeding up the evaporation process. Consequently, the planet does not survive as long as estimated by a simple application of mass loss rates without following consistently its evolution. We find out that the transit planet HD 209458b might be in such a dramatic phase, although with an extremely small probability. As a consequence, we predict that, after a certain time, only planets above a value mcrit(a) should be present at an orbital distance a of a star. For planets with initial masses above mcrit, evaporation does not affect the evolution of the radius with time.},

	Abstract = {We analyse pre-Main Sequence evolutionary tracks for low mass stars with masses m <= 1.4 Msun based on the Baraffe et al. (\cite{Bar98}) input physics. We also extend the recent Chabrier et al. (2000) evolutionary models based on dusty atmosphere to young brown dwarfs down to one mass of Jupiter. We analyse current theoretical uncertainties due to molecular line lists, convection and initial conditions. Simple tests on initial conditions show the high uncertainties of models at ages la 1 Myr. We find a significant sensitivity of atmosphere profiles to the treatment of convection at low gravity and Teff < 4000 K, whereas it vanishes as gravity increases. This effect adds another source of uncertainty on evolutionary tracks at very early phases. We show that at low surface gravity (log g <~ 3.5) the common picture of vertical Hayashi lines with constant Teff is oversimplified. The effect of a variation of initial deuterium abundance is studied. We compare our models with evolutionary tracks available in the literature and discuss the main differences. We finally analyse to what extent current observations of young systems provide a good test for pre-Main Sequence tracks.},

@article{Remus:2012a,
	Abstract = {Context. Earth-like planets have viscoelastic mantles, whereas giant planets may have viscoelastic cores. The tidal dissipation of these solid regions, which are gravitationally perturbed by a companion body, strongly depends on their rheology and the tidal frequency. Therefore, modeling tidal interactions provides constraints on planets' properties and helps us to understand their history and evolution, in either our solar system or exoplanetary systems.  Aims: We examine the equilibrium tide in the anelastic parts of a planet for every rheology, and by taking into account the presence of a fluid envelope of constant density. We show how to obtain the different Love numbers describing its tidal deformation, and discuss how the tidal dissipation in the solid parts depends on the planet's internal structure and rheology. Finally, we show how our results may be implemented to describe the dynamical evolution of planetary systems.  Methods: We expand in Fourier series the tidal potential exerted by a point mass companion, and express the dynamical equations in the orbital reference frame. The results are cast in the form of a complex disturbing function, which may be implemented directly in the equations governing the dynamical evolution of the system.  Results: The first manifestation of the tide is to distort the shape of the planet adiabatically along the line of centers. The response potential of the body to the tidal potential then defines the complex Love numbers, whose real part corresponds to the purely adiabatic elastic deformation and the imaginary part accounts for dissipation. The tidal kinetic energy is dissipated into heat by means of anelastic friction, which is modeled here by the imaginary part of the complex shear modulus. This dissipation is responsible for the imaginary part of the disturbing function, which is implemented in the dynamical evolution equations, from which we derive the characteristic evolution times.  Conclusions: The rate at which the system evolves depends on the physical properties of the tidal dissipation, and specifically on (1) how the shear modulus varies with tidal frequency, (2) the radius, and (3) the rheological properties of the solid core. The quantification of the tidal dissipation in the solid core of giant planets reveals a possible high dissipation that may compete with dissipation in fluid layers.},

	Abstract = {We present evolutionary models for low mass stars from 0.075 to 1 M_sun for solar-type metallicities [M/H]= 0 and -0.5. The calculations include the most recent interior physics and the latest generation of non-grey atmosphere models. We provide mass-age-color-magnitude relationships for both metallicities. The mass-M_V and mass-M_K relations are in excellent agreement with the empirical relations derived observationally. The theoretical color-magnitude diagrams are compared with the sequences of globular clusters (47 Tucanae) and open clusters (NGC2420 and NGC2477) observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Comparison is also made with field star sequences in M_V-(V-I), M_K-(I-K) and M_K-(J-K) diagrams. These comparisons show that the most recent improvements performed in low-mass star atmosphere models yield now reliable stellar models in the near-infrared. These models can be used for metallicity, mass, temperature and luminosity calibrations. Uncertainties still remain, however, in the optical spectral region below T_eff ~ 3700K, where predicted (V-I) colors are too blue by 0.5 mag for a given magnitude. The possible origins for such a discrepancy, most likely a missing source of opacity in the optical and the onset of grain formation are examined in detail.

	Abstract = {We have performed evolutionary calculations of very-low-mass stars from 0.08 to 0.8 M_sunl for different metallicites from [M/H]= -2.0 to -1.0 and we have tabulated the mechanical, thermal and photometric characteristics of these models. The calculations include the most recent interior physics and improved non-grey atmosphere models. The models reproduce the entire main sequences of the globular clusters observed with the Hubble Space Telescope over the afore-mentioned range of metallicity. Comparisons are made in the WFPC2 Flight system including the F555, F606 and F814 filters, and in the standard Johnson-Cousins system. We examine the effects of different physical parameters, mixing-length, alpha -enriched elements, helium fraction, as well as the accuracy of the photometric transformations of the HST data into standard systems. We derive mass-effective temperature and mass-magnitude relationships and we compare the results with the ones obtained with different grey-like approximations. These latter are shown to yield inaccurate relations, in particular near the hydrogen-burning limit. We derive new hydrogen-burning minimum masses, and the corresponding absolute magnitudes, for the different metallicities. We predict color-magnitude diagrams in the infrared NICMOS filters, to be used for the next generation of the HST observations, providing mass-magnitudes relationships in these colors down to the brown-dwarf limit. We show that the expected signature of the stellar to substellar transition in color-magnitude diagrams is a severe blueshift in the infrared colors, due to the increasing collision-induced absorption of molecular hydrogen with increasing density and decreasing temperature. At last, we apply these calculations to the observed halo field stars, which yields a precise determination of their metallicity, and thus of their galactic origin. We find no evidence for significant differences between the halo field stars and the globular cluster sequences.},

	Abstract = {We derive mass--spectral class relationships for M dwarfs in the mass range 0.075 <= m/M&sun; <= 0.6, which corresponds to a spectral range of M0--M10. The stellar models are based on the most recent nongray atmosphere models presently available. The results are in excellent agreement with the observed relationship derived by Kircpatrick & McCarthy for dwarfs of spectral type earlier than M7. We show that the spectral subclass is definitely not a linear function of mass and increases abruptly as the substellar mass limit is approached. This behavior reflects the observed trends in color, magnitude, and luminosity as a function of the mass and stems from the very physical properties of very low mass stars. Objects older than 1 Gyr with a spectral type earlier than M10 (for solar metallicity) are predicted to be main-sequence very low mass stars. For objects with such a spectral class to be bona fide brown dwarfs, they must be younger than 1 Gyr.},

Comparisons are made with observational results down to the bottom of the main sequence, for different metallicities, in magnitude-color and color-color diagrams. We find excellent agreement between theory and observations over the whole characteristic temperature/luminosity range.  This enables us to determine the mass of the faintest objects observed, which is found to be mlim ≈ 0.085 Msun for [M/H] = 0 and -0.5, and mlim = 0.09 Msun for [M/H] = -1.5, for an age of 10 Gyr.

@article{Remus:2012,
	Abstract = {Context. Since 1995, more than 500 extrasolar planets have been discovered orbiting very close to their parent star, where they experience strong tidal interactions. Their orbital evolution depends on the physical mechanisms that cause tidal dissipation, which remain poorly understood.  Aims: We refine the theory of the equilibrium tide in fluid bodies that are partly or entirely convective, to predict the dynamical evolution of the systems. In particular, we examine the validity of modeling the tidal dissipation using the quality factor Q, which is commonly done. We consider here the simplest case where the considered star or planet rotates uniformly, all spins are aligned, and the companion is reduced to a point mass.  Methods: We expand the tidal potential as a Fourier series, and express the hydrodynamical equations in the reference frame, which rotates with the corresponding Fourier component. The results are cast in the form of a complex disturbing function, which may be implemented directly in the equations governing the dynamical evolution of the system.  Results: The first manifestation of the tide is to distort the shape of the star or planet adiabatically along the line of centers. This generates the divergence-free velocity field of the adiabatic equilibrium tide, which is stationary in the frame rotating with the considered Fourier component of the tidal potential; this large-scale velocity field is decoupled from the dynamical tide. The tidal kinetic energy is dissipated into heat by means of turbulent friction, which is modeled here as an eddy-viscosity acting on the adiabatic tidal flow. This dissipation induces a second velocity field, the dissipative equilibrium tide, which is in quadrature with the exciting potential; this field is responsible for the imaginary part of the disturbing function, which is implemented in the dynamical evolution equations, from which one derives the characteristic evolutionary times.  Conclusions: The rate at which the system evolves depends on the physical properties of the tidal dissipation, and specifically on both how the eddy viscosity varies with tidal frequency and the thickness of the convective envelope for the fluid equilibrium tide. At low frequency, this tide is retarded by a constant time delay, whereas it lags behind by a constant angle when the tidal frequency exceeds the convective turnover rate.},

	Abstract = {It is likely that unambiguous habitable zone terrestrial planets of unknown water content will soon be discovered. Water content helps determine surface land fraction, which influences planetary weathering behavior. This is important because the silicate-weathering feedback determines the width of the habitable zone in space and time. Here a low-order model of weathering and climate, useful for gaining qualitative understanding, is developed to examine climate evolution for planets of various land-ocean fractions. It is pointed out that, if seafloor weathering does not depend directly on surface temperature, there can be no weathering-climate feedback on a waterworld. This would dramatically narrow the habitable zone of a waterworld. Results from our model indicate that weathering behavior does not depend strongly on land fraction for partially ocean-covered planets. This is powerful because it suggests that previous habitable zone theory is robust to changes in land fraction, as long as there is some land. Finally, a mechanism is proposed for a waterworld to prevent complete water loss during a moist greenhouse through rapid weathering of exposed continents. This process is named a "waterworld self-arrest," and it implies that waterworlds can go through a moist greenhouse stage and end up as planets like Earth with partial ocean coverage. This work stresses the importance of surface and geologic effects, in addition to the usual incident stellar flux, for habitability.},

	Abstract = {Context. CoRoT-2b is one of the most anomalously large exoplanet known. Given its high mass, its large radius cannot be explained by standard evolution models. Interestingly, the planet's parent star is an active, rapidly rotating solar-like star with with spots covering a large fraction (7-20%) of its visible surface.  Aims: We attempt to constrain the properties of the star-planet system and understand whether the planet's inferred large size may be caused a systematic error in the inferred parameters, and if not, how it can be explained.  Methods: We combine stellar and planetary evolution codes based on all available spectroscopic and photometric data to obtain self-consistent constraints on the system parameters.  Results: We find no systematic error in the stellar modeling (including spots and stellar activity) that would cause a ~10% reduction in size of the star and thus the planet. Two classes of solutions are found: the usual main-sequence solution for the star yields for the planet a mass of 3.67 $\pm$ 0.13 MJ, a radius of 1.55 $\pm$ 0.03 RJ for an age that is at least 130 Ma and should be younger than 500 Ma given the star's rapid rotation and significant activity. We identify another class of solutions on the pre-main sequence, for which the planet's mass is 3.45 $\pm$ 0.27 MJ and its radius is 1.50 $\pm$ 0.06 RJ for an age of 30 to 40 Ma. These extremely young solutions provide the simplest explanation of the planet's size that can then be matched by a simple contraction from an initially hot, expanded state, if the atmospheric opacities are larger by a factor of ~3 than usually assumed for solar composition atmospheres. Other solutions imply that the present inflated radius of CoRoT-2b is transient and the result of an event that occurred less than 20 Ma ago, i.e., a giant impact with another Jupiter-mass planet, or interactions with another object in the system that caused a significant rise in the eccentricity followed by the rapid circularization of its orbit.  Conclusions: Additional observations of CoRoT-2 that could help us to understand this system include searches for an infrared excess, a debris disk, and additional companions. The determination of a complete infrared lightcurve including both the primary and secondary transits would also be extremely valuable to constrain the planet's atmospheric properties and determine the planet-to-star radius ratio in a manner less vulnerable to systematic errors caused by stellar activity.},

It also holds some of the keys to understanding the formation of our Solar System and the evolution of giant planets in general. While the exploration by the Cassini-Huygens mission has led to great advances in our understanding of the planet and its moons, it has left us with puzzling questions: What is the bulk composition of the planet? Does it have a helium core? Is it enriched in noble gases like Jupiter? What powers and controls its gigantic storms? We have learned that we can measure an outer magnetic field that is filtered from its non-axisymmetric components, but what is Saturn's inner magnetic field?

	Abstract = {In principle, the combined measurements of the mass and radius of a giant exoplanet allow one to determine the relative fraction of hydrogen and helium and of heavy elements in the planet. However, uncertainties on the underlying physics imply that some known transiting planets appear anomalously large, and this generally prevents any firm conclusion when a planet is considered on an individual basis. On the basis of a sample of nine transiting planets known at that time, Guillot et al (1996 Astron. Astrophys.453 L21) concluded that all planets could be explained with the same set of hypotheses, either by large but plausible modifications of the equations of state, opacities, or by the addition of an energy source, probably related to the dissipation of kinetic energy by tides. On this basis, they concluded that the amount of heavy elements in close-in giant planets is correlated with the metallicity of the parent star. Furthermore, they showed that planets around metal-rich stars can possess large amounts of heavy elements, up to 100 Earth masses. These results are confirmed by studying the present sample of 18 transiting planets with masses between that of Saturn and twice the mass of Jupiter.},

	Abstract = {Context.Nine extrasolar planets with masses between 110 and 430 M_⊕ are known to transit their star. The knowledge of their masses and radii allows an estimate of their composition, but uncertainties on equations of state, opacities and possible missing energy sources imply that only inaccurate constraints can be derived when considering each planet separately.Aims.We seek to better understand the composition of transiting extrasolar planets by considering them as an ensemble, and by comparing the obtained planetary properties to that of the parent stars.Methods.We use evolution models and constraints on the stellar ages to derive the mass of heavy elements present in the planets. Possible additional energy sources like tidal dissipation due to an inclined orbit or to downward kinetic energy transport are considered.Results.We show that the nine transiting planets discovered so far belong to a quite homogeneous ensemble that is characterized by a mass of heavy elements that is a relatively steep function of the stellar metallicity, from less than 20 earth masses of heavy elements around solar composition stars, to up to ~100 M_⊕ for three times the solar metallicity (the precise values being model-dependant). The correlation is still to be ascertained however. Statistical tests imply a worst-case 1/3 probability of a false positive.Conclusions.Together with the observed lack of giant planets in close orbits around metal-poor stars, these results appear to imply that heavy elements play a key role in the formation of close-in giant planets. The large masses of heavy elements inferred for planets orbiting metal rich stars was not anticipated by planet formation models and shows the need for alternative theories including migration and subsequent collection of planetesimals.},

	Abstract = {It has been proposed that the enrichment in noble gases found by Galileo in the atmosphere of Jupiter can be explained by their delivery inside cold planetesimals. We propose instead that this is a sign that the planet formed in a chemically evolved disc and that noble gases were acquired mostly in gaseous form during the envelope capture phase of the planet.  We show that the combined settling of grains to the disc mid-plane in the cold outer layers, the condensation of noble gases on to these grains at temperatures below 20-30 K, and the evaporation from high disc altitudes effectively lead to a progressive, moderate enrichment of the disc. The fact that noble gases are vaporized from the grains in the hot inner disc regions (e.g. Jupiter formation region) is not a concern because a negative temperature gradient prevents convection from carrying the species into the evaporating region. We show that the ~2 times solar enrichment of Ar, Kr and Xe in Jupiter is hence naturally explained by a continuous growth of the planet governed by viscous diffusion in the protosolar disc in conjunction with an evaporation of the disc and its progressive enrichment on a million-year time-scale.},

	Abstract = {We know that giant planets played a crucial role in the making of our Solar System. The discovery of giant planets orbiting other stars is a formidable opportunity to learn more about these objects, what their composition is, how various processes influence their structure and evolution, and most importantly how they form. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune can be studied in detail, mostly from close spacecraft flybys. We can infer that they are all enriched in heavy elements compared to the Sun, with the relative global enrichments increasing with distance to the Sun. We can also infer that they possess dense cores of varied masses. The intercomparison of presently characterized extrasolar giant planets shows that they are also mainly made of hydrogen and helium, but that they either have significantly different amounts of heavy elements, have had different orbital evolutions, or both. Hence, many questions remain and need to be answered to make significant progress on the origins of planets.},

	Abstract = {About one-quarter of the extrasolar giant planets discovered so far have orbital distances smaller than 0.1 AU. These ``51 Peg b-like'' planets can now be directly characterized, as shown by the planet transiting in front the star HD 209458. We review the processes that affect their evolution. We apply our work to the case of HD 209458b, whose radius has been recently measured. We argue that its radius can be reproduced only when the deep atmosphere is assumed to be unrealistically hot. When using more realistic atmospheric temperatures, an energy source appears to be missing in order to explain HD 209458b's large size. The most likely source of energy available is not in the planet's spin or orbit, but in the intense radiation received from the parent star. We show that the radius of HD 209458b can be reproduced if a small fraction ($ im$1%) of the stellar flux is transformed into kinetic energy in the planetary atmosphere and subsequently converted to thermal energy by dynamical processes at pressures of tens of bars.},

	Abstract = {An understanding of the structure and composition of the giant planets is rapidly evolving because of (i) high-pressure experiments with the ability to study metallic hydrogen and define the properties of its equation of state and (ii) spectroscopic and in situ measurements made by telescopes and satellites that allow an accurate determination of the chemical composition of the deep atmospheres of the giant planets. However, the total amount of heavy elements that Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune contain remains poorly constrained. The discovery of extrasolar giant planets with masses ranging from that of Saturn to a few times the mass of Jupiter opens up new possibilities for understanding planet composition and formation. Evolutionary models predict that gaseous extrasolar giant planets should have a variety of atmospheric temperatures and chemical compositions, but the radii are estimated to be close to that of Jupiter (between 0.9 and 1.7 Jupiter radii), provided that they contain mostly hydrogen and helium.},

@article{Guillot:1999,
	Abstract = {Interior models of Jupiter and Saturn are calculated and compared in the framework of the three-layer assumption, which rely on the perception that both planets consist of three globally homogeneous regions: a dense core, a metallic hydrogen envelope, and a molecular hydrogen envelope. Within this framework, constraints on the core mass and abundance of heavy elements (i.e. elements other than hydrogen and helium) are given by accounting for uncertainties on the measured gravitational moments, surface temperature, surface helium abundance, and on the inferred protosolar helium abundance, equations of state, temperature profile and solid/differential interior rotation. Results obtained solely from static models matching the measured gravitational fields indicate that the mass of Jupiter's dense core is less than 14 M⊕ (Earth masses), but that models with no core are possible given the current uncertainties on the hydrogen-helium equation of state. Similarly, Saturn's core mass is less than 22 M⊕ but no lower limit can be inferred. The total mass of heavy elements (including that in the core) is constrained to lie between 11 and 42 M⊕ in Jupiter, and between 19 and 31 M⊕ in Saturn. The enrichment in heavy elements of their molecular envelopes is 1-6.5, and 0.5-12 times the solar value, respectively. Additional constraints from evolution models accounting for the progressive differentiation of helium (Hubbard WB, Guillot T, Marley MS, Burrows A, Lunine JI, Saumon D, 1999. Comparative evolution of Jupiter and Saturn. Planet. Space Sci. 47, 1175-1182) are used to obtain tighter, albeit less robust, constraints. The resulting core masses are then expected to be in the range 0-10 M⊕, and 6-17 M⊕ for Jupiter and Saturn, respectively. Furthermore, it is shown that Saturn's atmospheric helium mass mixing ratio, as derived from Voyager, Y=0.06+/-0.05, is probably too low. Static and evolution models favor a value of Y=0.11-0.25. Using, Y=0.16+/-0.05, Saturn's molecular region is found to be enriched in heavy elements by 3.5 to 10 times the solar value, in relatively good agreement with the measured methane abundance. Finally, in all cases, the gravitational moment J6 of models matching all the constraints are found to lie between 0.35 and 0.38×10-4 for Jupiter, and between 0.90 and 0.98×10-4 for Saturn, assuming solid rotation. For comparison, the uncertainties on the measured J6 are about 10 times larger. More accurate measurements of J6 (as expected from the Cassini orbiter for Saturn) will therefore permit to test the validity of interior models calculations and the magnitude of differential rotation in the planetary interior.},

We conclude that, except for helium which must be more abundant in the metallic interior than in the molecular envelope, Jupiter could be homogeneous (no core) or could have a central dense core up to 12 M_⊕. The mass fraction of heavy elements is less than 7.5 times the solar value in the metallic envelope and between 1 and 7.2 times solar in the molecular envelope.

	Abstract = {Using Doppler spectroscopy to detect the reflex motion of the nearby star, 51 Pegasi, Mayor & Queloz (1995) claim to have discovered a giant planet in a 0.05 AU, 4.23 day orbit. They estimate its mass to be in the range 0.5--2 Jupiter masses, but are not able to determine its nature or origin. Including the effects of the severe stellar insolation implied, we extend the theory of giant planets we have recently developed to encompass those at very small orbital distances. Our calculations can be used to help formulate search strategies for luminous planets in tight orbits around other nearby stars. We calculate the radii and luminosities of such giant planets for a variety of compositions (H/He, He, H2O, and olivine), the evolutionary tracks for solar-composition gas giants, and the geometry of the Hayashi forbidden zone in the gas-giant mass regime. We show that such planets are stable and estimate the magnitude of classical Jeans evaporation and of photodissociation and loss due to EUV radiation. In addition, we demonstrate that for the mass range quoted, such planets are well within their Roche lobes. We show that the strong composition dependence of the model radii and the distinctive spectral signatures provide clear diagnostics that might reveal 51 Peg B's nature, should interferometric or adaptive-optics techniques ever succeed in photometrically separating planet from star.},

	Abstract = {Conventional evolutionary models for Jupiter and Saturn, which assume convection throughout the entire planet interior, yield ages of 5.1 Gyr for Jupiter and 2.6 Gyr for Saturn. Even though the discrepancy for Saturn can be explained by the additional energy source due to a phase separation of helium, it seems difficult to reconcile the age of fully convective Jovian models with the age of the solar system, i.e., 4.5 Gyr.  It has been recently shown that these planets are probably not fully convective, but retain a stable radiative window near the surface.  We present new evolutionary models for these two planets, which do include the aforementioned possibility of radiative transport in the molecular hydrogen-helium envelope. These calculations yield ages of 4.2 Gyr for Jupiter and 2.4 Gyr for Saturn. We show that the importance of the radiative window was larger in the past than now, so that the ratio of the radiative to the adiabatic gradient in the radiative region increases with time. This speeds up the cooling with respect to a fully adiabatic planet.  Since the interiors of the new Jupiter and Saturn models are significantly cooler than the adiabatic ones, it is likely that immiscibility of helium occurs in both planets. That provides a natural explanation for the observed helium depletion in their atmospheres and the fact that the ages inferred from homogeneous evolution models of these two planets are smaller than the age of the solar system.},

	Abstract = {The condensation of chemical species of high molecular mass such as methane, ammonia, and water can inhibit convection in the hydrogen-helium atmospheres of the giant planets. Convection is inhibited in Uranus and Neptune when methane reaches an abundance of about 15 times the solar value and in Jupiter and Saturn if the abundance of water is more than about five times the solar value. The temperature gradient consequently becomes superadiabatic, which is observed in temperature profiles inferred from radio-occultation measurements. The planetary heat flux is then likely to be transported by another mechanism, possibly radiation in Uranus, or diffusive convection.},

	Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to describe the numerical techniques used in the code CEPAM, developed to study the internal structure of giant planets. The main originality of CEPAM is the solution of the two point boundary value problem of the quasi-static equilibrium by a collocation implicit method based on piecewise polynomial approximations projected on a B-spline basis. An automatic mesh refinement is designed to adjust the location of the grid points depending on the variation in the unknowns. Moreover, a grid point can be adjusted at any determined position. This allows an exact treatment of the problem, even when the first derivatives of the integration variables (M, R, P, T, L) are discontinuous. A robust optimization method allows the calculation of models matching the observed equatorial radius and gravitational moments. The numerical accuracy of the models calculated is found to be satisfactory even with a small number of mesh points (the relative accuracy is better than 10^-5^ on all the variables with 100 mesh points). The whole precision of models of giant planets is limited by the accuracy of physical data.},

	Abstract = {We present the first three-dimensional circulation models for extrasolar gas giant atmospheres with geometrically and energetically consistent treatments of magnetic drag and ohmic dissipation. Atmospheric resistivities are continuously updated and calculated directly from the flow structure, strongly coupling the magnetic effects with the circulation pattern. We model the hot Jupiters HD 189733b (T eq ≈ 1200 K) and HD 209458b (T eq ≈ 1500 K) and test planetary magnetic field strengths from 0 to 30 G. We find that even at B = 3 G the atmospheric structure and circulation of HD 209458b are strongly influenced by magnetic effects, while the cooler HD 189733b remains largely unaffected, even in the case of B = 30 G and super-solar metallicities. Our models of HD 209458b indicate that magnetic effects can substantially slow down atmospheric winds, change circulation and temperature patterns, and alter observable properties. These models establish that longitudinal and latitudinal hot spot offsets, day-night flux contrasts, and planetary radius inflation are interrelated diagnostics of the magnetic induction process occurring in the atmospheres of hot Jupiters and other similarly forced exoplanets. Most of the ohmic heating occurs high in the atmosphere and on the dayside of the planet, while the heating at depth is strongly dependent on the internal heat flux assumed for the planet, with more heating when the deep atmosphere is hot. We compare the ohmic power at depth in our models, and estimates of the ohmic dissipation in the bulk interior (from general scaling laws), to evolutionary models that constrain the amount of heating necessary to explain the inflated radius of HD 209458b. Our results suggest that deep ohmic heating can successfully inflate the radius of HD 209458b for planetary magnetic field strengths of B >= 3-10 G.},

	Abstract = {Remote observing of exoplanetary atmospheres is now possible, offering us access to circulation regimes unlike any of the familiar solar system cases. Atmospheric circulation models are being developed to study these new regimes but model validations and intercomparisons are needed to establish their consistency and accuracy. To this end, we present a simple Earth-like validation of the pseudospectral solver of meteorological equations called Intermediate General Circulation Model (IGCM), based on Newtonian relaxation to a prescribed latitudinal profile of equilibrium temperatures. We then describe a straightforward and idealized model extension to the atmospheric flow on a hot Jupiter with the same IGCM solver. This shallow, three-dimensional hot Jupiter model is based on Newtonian relaxation to a permanent day-night pattern of equilibrium temperatures and the absence of surface drag. The baroclinic regime1 of the Earth's lower atmosphere is contrasted with the more barotropic regime of the simulated hot Jupiter flow. For plausible conditions at the 0.1-1 bar pressure level on HD 209458b, the simulated flow is characterized by unsteadiness, subsonic wind speeds, a zonally perturbed superrotating equatorial jet and large-scale polar vortices. Violation of the Rayleigh-Kuo inflexion point criterion on the flanks of the accelerating equatorial jet indicates that barotropic (horizontal shear) instabilities may be important dynamical features of the simulated flow. Similarities and differences with previously published simulated hot Jupiter flows are briefly noted.},

@article{Menou:2012a,
	Abstract = {The atmospheres of hot Jupiters and other strongly forced exoplanets are susceptible to a thermal instability in the presence of ohmic dissipation, weak magnetic drag, and strong winds. The instability occurs in radiatively dominated atmospheric regions when the ohmic dissipation rate increases with temperature faster than the radiative (cooling) rate. The instability domain covers a specific range of atmospheric pressures and temperatures, typically P ~ 3-300 mbar and T ~ 1500-2500 K for hot Jupiters, which makes it a candidate mechanism to explain the dayside thermal "inversions" inferred for a number of such exoplanets. The instability is suppressed by high levels of non-thermal photoionization, in possible agreement with a recently established observational trend. We highlight several shortcomings of the instability treatment presented here. Understanding the emergence and outcome of the instability, which should result in locally hotter atmospheres with stronger levels of drag, will require global nonlinear atmospheric models with adequate MHD prescriptions.},

	Abstract = {The exoplanet GJ1214b presents an interesting example of compositional degeneracy for low-mass planets. Its atmosphere may be composed of water, super-solar or solar metallicity material. We present atmospheric circulation models of GJ1214b for these three compositions, with explicit gray radiative transfer and an optional treatment of MHD bottom drag. All models develop strong, superrotating zonal winds (~1-2 km s-1). The degree of eastward heat advection, which can be inferred from secondary eclipse and thermal phase curve measurements, varies greatly between the models. These differences are understood as resulting from variations in the radiative times at the thermal photosphere, caused by separate molecular weight and opacity effects. Our GJ1214b models illustrate how atmospheric circulation can be used as a probe of composition for similar tidally locked exoplanets in the mini-Neptune/waterworld class.},

@article{Menou:2010,
	Abstract = {Radiative transfer in planetary atmospheres is usually treated in the static limit, i.e., neglecting atmospheric motions. We argue that hot Jupiter atmospheres, with possibly fast (sonic) wind speeds, may require a more strongly coupled treatment, formally in the regime of radiation hydrodynamics. To lowest order in v/c, relativistic Doppler shifts distort line profiles along optical paths with finite wind velocity gradients. This leads to flow-dependent deviations in the effective emission and absorption properties of the atmospheric medium. Evaluating the overall impact of these distortions on the radiative structure of a dynamic atmosphere is non-trivial. We present transmissivity and systematic equivalent width excess calculations which suggest possibly important consequences for radiation transport in hot Jupiter atmospheres. If winds are fast and bulk Doppler shifts are indeed important for the global radiative balance, accurate modeling and reliable data interpretation for hot Jupiter atmospheres may prove challenging: it would involve anisotropic and dynamic radiative transfer in a coupled radiation-hydrodynamical flow. On the bright side, it would also imply that the emergent properties of hot Jupiter atmospheres are more direct tracers of their atmospheric flows than is the case for solar system planets. Radiation hydrodynamics may also influence radiative transfer in other classes of hot exoplanetary atmospheres with fast winds.},

	Abstract = {In the solar system, the planets' compositions vary with orbital distance, with rocky planets in close orbits and lower-density gas giants in wider orbits. The detection of close-in giant planets around other stars was the first clue that this pattern is not universal and that planets' orbits can change substantially after their formation. Here, we report another violation of the orbit-composition pattern: two planets orbiting the same star with orbital distances differing by only 10% and densities differing by a factor of 8. One planet is likely a rocky ``super-Earth,'' whereas the other is more akin to Neptune. These planets are 20 times more closely spaced and have a larger density contrast than any adjacent pair of planets in the solar system.},

	Abstract = {We present the discovery of a super-Earth-sized planet in or near the habitable zone of a Sun-like star. The host is Kepler-69, a 13.7 mag G4V-type star. We detect two periodic sets of transit signals in the 3-year flux time series of Kepler-69, obtained with the Kepler spacecraft. Using the very high precision Kepler photometry, and follow-up observations, our confidence that these signals represent planetary transits is >99.3%. The inner planet, Kepler-69b, has a radius of 2.24^{+0.44}_{-0.29} R ⊕ and orbits the host star every 13.7 days. The outer planet, Kepler-69c, is a super-Earth-sized object with a radius of 1.7^{+0.34}_{-0.23} R ⊕ and an orbital period of 242.5 days. Assuming an Earth-like Bond albedo, Kepler-69c has an equilibrium temperature of 299 $\pm$ 19 K, which places the planet close to the habitable zone around the host star. This is the smallest planet found by Kepler to be orbiting in or near the habitable zone of a Sun-like star and represents an important step on the path to finding the first true Earth analog.},

	Abstract = {We measure the mass and radius of the star and planet in the TrES-2 system using 2.7 years of observations by the Kepler spacecraft. The light curve shows evidence for ellipsoidal variations and Doppler beaming on a period consistent with the orbital period of the planet with amplitudes of 2.79+0.44 -0.62 and 3.44+0.32 -0.37 parts per million (ppm), respectively, and a difference between the dayside and the nightside planetary flux of 3.41+0.55 -0.82 ppm. We present an asteroseismic analysis of solar-like oscillations on TrES-2A which we use to calculate the stellar mass of 0.94 $\pm$ 0.05 M &sun; and radius of 0.95 $\pm$ 0.02 R &sun;. Using these stellar parameters, a transit model fit and the phase-curve variations, we determine the planetary radius of 1.162+0.020 -0.024 R Jup and derive a mass for TrES-2b from the photometry of 1.44 $\pm$ 0.21 M Jup. The ratio of the ellipsoidal variation to the Doppler beaming amplitudes agrees to better than 2sigma with theoretical predications, while our measured planet mass and radius agree within 2sigma of previously published values based on spectroscopic radial velocity measurements. We measure a geometric albedo of 0.0136+0.0022 -0.0033 and an occultation (secondary eclipse) depth of 6.5+1.7 -1.8 ppm which we combined with the day/night planetary flux ratio to model the atmosphere of TrES-2b. We find that an atmosphere model that contains a temperature inversion is strongly preferred. We hypothesize that the Kepler bandpass probes a significantly greater atmospheric depth on the night side relative to the day side.},

	Abstract = {Since the discovery of the first exoplanets, it has been known that other planetary systems can look quite unlike our own. Until fairly recently, we have been able to probe only the upper range of the planet size distribution, and, since last year, to detect planets that are the size of Earth or somewhat smaller. Hitherto, no planets have been found that are smaller than those we see in the Solar System. Here we report a planet significantly smaller than Mercury. This tiny planet is the innermost of three that orbit the Sun-like host star, which we have designated Kepler-37. Owing to its extremely small size, similar to that of the Moon, and highly irradiated surface, the planet, Kepler-37b, is probably rocky with no atmosphere or water, similar to Mercury.},

	Abstract = {Having discovered 885 planet candidates in 361 multiple-planet systems, Kepler has made transits a powerful method for studying the statistics of planetary systems. The orbits of only two pairs of planets in these candidate systems are apparently unstable. This indicates that a high percentage of the candidate systems are truly planets orbiting the same star, motivating physical investigations of the population. Pairs of planets in this sample are typically not in orbital resonances. However, pairs with orbital period ratios within a few percent of a first-order resonance (e.g. 2:1, 3:2) prefer orbital spacings just wide of the resonance and avoid spacings just narrow of the resonance. Finally, we investigate mutual inclinations based on transit duration ratios. We infer that the inner planets of pairs tend to have a smaller impact parameter than their outer companions, suggesting these planetary systems are typically coplanar to within a few degrees.},

	Abstract = {We estimate the stellar parameters of late K- and early M-type Kepler target stars. We obtain medium-resolution visible spectra of 382 stars with KP - J > 2 (simeK5 and later spectral type). We determine luminosity class by comparing the strength of gravity-sensitive indices (CaH, K I, Ca II, and Na I) to their strength in a sample of stars of known luminosity class. We find that giants constitute 96% $\pm$ 1% of the bright (KP < 14) Kepler target stars, and 7% $\pm$ 3% of dim (KP > 14) stars, significantly higher than fractions based on the stellar parameters quoted in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). The KIC effective temperatures are systematically (110+15 - 35 K) higher than temperatures we determine from fitting our spectra to PHOENIX stellar models. Through Monte Carlo simulations of the Kepler exoplanet candidate population, we find a planet occurrence of 0.36 $\pm$ 0.08 when giant stars are properly removed, somewhat higher than when a KIC log g > 4 criterion is used (0.27 $\pm$ 0.05). Last, we show that there is no significant difference in g - r color (a probe of metallicity) between late-type Kepler stars with transiting Earth-to-Neptune-size exoplanet candidates and dwarf stars with no detected transits. We show that a previous claimed offset between these two populations is most likely an artifact of including a large number of misidentified giants.},

@article{Maldonado:2012,
	Abstract = {Context. Around 16% of the solar-like stars in our neighbourhood show IR-excesses due to dusty debris discs and a fraction of them are known to host planets. Determining whether these stars follow any special trend in their properties is important to understand debris disc and planet formation.  Aims: We aim to determine in a homogeneous way the metallicity of a sample of stars with known debris discs and planets. We attempt to identify trends related to debris discs and planets around solar-type stars.  Methods: Our analysis includes the calculation of the fundamental stellar parameters Teff, log g, microturbulent velocity, and metallicity by applying the iron ionisation equilibrium conditions to several isolated Fe i and Fe ii lines. High-resolution {\'e}chelle spectra (R ~ 57 000) from 2, 3 m class telescopes are used. Our derived metallicities are compared with other results in the literature, which finally allows us to extend the stellar samples in a consistent way.  Results: The metallicity distributions of the different stellar samples suggest that there is a transition toward higher metallicities from stars with neither debris discs nor planets to stars hosting giant planets. Stars with debris discs and stars with neither debris nor planets follow a similar metallicity distribution, although the distribution of the first ones might be shifted towards higher metallicities. Stars with debris discs and planets have the same metallicity behaviour as stars hosting planets, irrespective of whether the planets are low-mass or gas giants. In the case of debris discs and giant planets, the planets are usually cool, - semimajor axis larger than 0.1 AU (20 out of 22 planets), even ≈65% have semimajor axis larger than 0.5 AU. The data also suggest that stars with debris discs and cool giant planets tend to have a low dust luminosity, and are among the less luminous debris discs known. We also find evidence of an anticorrelation between the luminosity of the dust and the planet eccentricity.  Conclusions: Our data show that the presence of planets, not the debris disc, correlates with the stellar metallicity. The results confirm that core-accretion models represent suitable scenarios for debris disc and planet formation. These conclusions are based on a number of stars with discs and planets considerably larger than in previous works, in particular stars hosting low-mass planets and debris discs. Dynamical instabilities produced by eccentric giant planets could explain the suggested dust luminosity trends observed for stars with debris discs and planets.

	Abstract = {We determine in a homogeneous way the metallicity and individual abundances of a large sample of evolved stars, with and without known planetary companions. Our methodology is based on the analysis of high-resolution echelle spectra. The metallicity distributions show that giant stars hosting planets are not preferentially metal-rich having similar abundance patterns to giant stars without known planetary companions. We have found, however, a very strong relation between the metallicity distribution and the stellar mass within this sample. We show that the less massive giant stars with planets (M < 1.5 Msun) are not metal rich, but, the metallicity of the sample of massive (M > 1.5 Msun), young (age < 2 Gyr) giant stars with planets is higher than that of a similar sample of stars without planets. Regarding other chemical elements, giant stars with and without planets in the mass domain M < 1.5 Msun show similar abundance patterns. However, planet and non-planet hosts with masses M > 1.5 Msun show differences in the abundances of some elements, specially Na, Co, and Ni. In addition, we find the sample of subgiant stars with planets to be metal rich showing similar metallicities to main-sequence planet hosts. The fact that giant planet hosts in the mass domain M < 1.5 Msun do not show metal-enrichment is difficult to explain. Given that these stars have similar stellar parameters to subgiants and main-sequence planet hosts, the lack of the metal-rich signature in low-mass giants could be explained if originated from a pollution scenario in the main sequence that gets erased as the star become fully convective. However, there is no physical reason why it should play a role for giants with masses M < 1.5 Msun but is not observed for giants with M > 1.5 Msun.},

	Abstract = {Various effective temperature scales have been proposed over the years. Despite much work and the high internal precision usually achieved, systematic differences of order 100 K (or more) among various scales are still present. We present an investigation based on the infrared flux method aimed at assessing the source of such discrepancies and pin down their origin. We break the impasse among different scales by using a large set of solar twins, stars which are spectroscopically and photometrically identical to the Sun, to set the absolute zero point of the effective temperature scale to within few degrees. Our newly calibrated, accurate and precise temperature scale applies to dwarfs and subgiants, from super-solar metallicities to the most metal-poor stars currently known. At solar metallicities our results validate spectroscopic effective temperature scales, whereas for [Fe/H]⪅ -2.5 our temperatures are roughly 100 K hotter than those determined from model fits to the Balmer lines and 200 K hotter than those obtained from the excitation equilibrium of Fe lines. Empirical bolometric corrections and useful relations linking photometric indices to effective temperatures and angular diameters have been derived. Our results take full advantage of the high accuracy reached in absolute calibration in recent years and are further validated by interferometric angular diameters and space based spectrophotometry over a wide range of effective temperatures and metallicities.

	Abstract = {We empirically determine effective temperatures and bolometric luminosities for a large sample of nearby M dwarfs, for which high accuracy optical and infrared photometry is available. We introduce a new technique which exploits the flux ratio in different bands as a proxy of both effective temperature and metallicity. Our temperature scale for late-type dwarfs extends well below 3000K (almost to the brown dwarf limit) and is supported by interferometric angular diameter measurements above 3000K. Our metallicities are in excellent agreement (usually within 0.2dex) with recent determinations via independent techniques. A subsample of cool M dwarfs with metallicity estimates based on hotter Hipparcos common proper motion companions indicates our metallicities are also reliable below 3000K, a temperature range unexplored until now. The high quality of our data allows us to identify a striking feature in the bolometric luminosity versus temperature plane, around the transition from K to M dwarfs. We have compared our sample of stars with theoretical models and conclude that this transition is due to an increase in the radii of the M dwarfs, a feature which is not reproduced by theoretical models.},

	Abstract = {We use nearby K dwarf stars to measure the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio DeltaY/DeltaZ, a diagnostic of the chemical history of the solar neighbourhood. Our sample of K dwarfs has homogeneously determined effective temperatures, bolometric luminosities and metallicities, allowing us to fit each star to the appropriate stellar isochrone and determine its helium content indirectly. We use a newly computed set of Padova isochrones which cover a wide range of helium and metal content.  Our theoretical isochrones have been checked against a congruous set of main-sequence binaries with accurately measured masses, to discuss and validate their range of applicability. We find that the stellar masses deduced from the isochrones are usually in excellent agreement with empirical measurements. Good agreement is also found with empirical mass-luminosity relations.  Despite fitting the masses of the stars very well, we find that anomalously low helium content (lower than primordial helium) is required to fit the luminosities and temperatures of the metal-poor K dwarfs, while more conventional values of the helium content are derived for the stars around solar metallicity.  We have investigated the effect of diffusion in stellar models and the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) in deriving metallicities. Neither of these is able to resolve the low-helium problem alone and only marginally if the cumulated effects are included, unless we assume a mixing-length which is strongly decreasing with metallicity. Further work in stellar models is urgently needed.  The helium-to-metal enrichment ratio is found to be DeltaY/DeltaZ = 2.1 +/- 0.9 around and above solar metallicity, consistent with previous studies, whereas open problems still remain at the lowest metallicities. Finally, we determine the helium content for a set of planetary host stars.},

	Abstract = {For a sample of 104 GK dwarfs with excellent multi-band photometry, parallax and metallicity determination, we compare the observed broad-band colours with those computed from the most recent synthetic libraries. We find good agreement in the optical bands, whereas some discrepancies still remain in the infrared.  We derive our own implementation of the InfraRed Flux Method (IRFM) to recover, from multi-band photometry, accurate effective temperatures, bolometric luminosities and angular diameters of such stars.  We find very tight relations between photometric indices and the fundamental physical parameters of the stars. In particular, the relation between angular diameters and J-band index shows remarkably small scatter. Our IRFM temperature scale is 100~K hotter than recent analogous determinations in the literature, but is in agreement with spectroscopically calibrated temperature scales. Our smaller angular diameters are more in line with the limb-darkening correction predicted by the latest 3D model atmospheres and also with asteroseismology.},

	Abstract = {We compare a large sample of nearby K dwarfs with a set of theoretical isochrones computed with different helium and metallicity content, with the main aim to determine the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio Delta Y / Delta Z in the Solar Neighbourhood. For all stars we have derived homogeneous fundamental stellar parameters which allow us to study the broadening of the Low Main Sequence in the theoretical HR diagram, where the effects of helium and Delta Y / Delta Z are more prominent. Surprisingly, the offset between the metal rich and metal poor Main Sequence is less than expected, so that to fit metal poor dwarfs, stellar models with anomalously low helium content must be used. We have investigated various effects that could help in solving such a problem.  Our theoretical isochrones are then checked against a congruous set of Main Sequence binaries to discuss and validate their applicability range. The helium-to-metal enrichment ratio is found to be Delta Y / Delta Z = 2.0 $\pm$ 1.0 around solar metallicity whereas open problems still remain at the lowest metallicities.},

	Abstract = {Context. Accurate physical properties of eclipsing stars provide important constraints on models of stellar structure and evolution, especially when combined with spectroscopic information on their chemical composition. Empirical calibrations of the data also lead to accurate mass and radius estimates for exoplanet host stars. Finally, accurate data for unusual stellar subtypes, such as Am stars, also help to unravel the cause(s) of their peculiarities.  Aims: We aim to determine the masses, radii, effective temperatures, detailed chemical composition and rotational speeds for the Am-type eclipsing binaries SW CMa (A4-5m) and HW CMa (A6m) and compare them with similar normal stars.  Methods: Accurate radial velocities from the Digital Speedometers of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics were combined with previously published uvby photometry to determine precise physical parameters for the four stars. A detailed abundance analysis was performed from high-resolution spectra obtained with the Nordic Optical Telescope (La Palma).  Results: We find the masses of the (relatively evolved) stars in SW CMa to be 2.10 and 2.24 M&sun;, with radii of 2.50 and 3.01 R&sun;, while the (essentially zero-age) stars in HW CMa have masses of 1.72 and 1.78 M&sun;, radii of 1.64 and 1.66 R&sun; - all with errors well below 2%. Detailed atmospheric abundances for one or both components were determined for 14 elements in SW CMa ([Fe/H] = +0.49/+0.61 dex) and 16 in HW CMa ([Fe/H] = +0.33/+0.32 dex); both abundance patterns are characteristic of metallic-line stars. Both systems are well fit by current stellar evolution models for assumed bulk abundances of [Fe/H] = +0.05 and +0.23, respectively ([alpha/Fe] = 0.0), and ages of ~700 Myr and 160 Myr.

	Abstract = {When making use of tabulations of empirical bolometric corrections for stars (BC V ), a commonly overlooked fact is that while the zero point is arbitrary, the bolometric magnitude of the Sun (M bol,sun) that is used in combination with such tables cannot be chosen arbitrarily. It must be consistent with the zero point of BC V  so that the apparent brightness of the Sun is reproduced. The latter is a measured quantity, for which we adopt the value V sun = -26.76 $\pm$ 0.03. Inconsistent values of M bol,sun are listed in many of the most popular sources of BC V . We quantify errors that are introduced by failure to pay attention to this detail. We also take the opportunity to reprint the BC V  coefficients of the often used polynomial fits by Flower, which were misprinted in the original publication.},

	Abstract = {The bright, K1 III-IV star gamma Cep has been reported previously to have a possibly substellar companion in a ~2.5 yr orbit, as well as an unseen stellar companion at a larger separation. We determine for the first time the three-dimensional orbit of the latter, accounting also for the perturbation from the closer object. We combine new and existing radial velocity measurements with intermediate astrometric data from the Hipparcos mission (abscissa residuals), as well as ground-based positional observations going back more than a century. The orbit of the secondary star is eccentric (e=0.4085+/-0.0065) and has a period P=66.8+/-1.4 yr. We establish the primary star to be on the first ascent of the giant branch and to have a mass of 1.18+/-0.11 Msolar, an effective temperature of 4800+/-100 K, and an age around 6.6 Gyr (for an assumed metallicity [Fe/H]=+0.01+/-0.05). The unseen secondary star is found to be an M4 dwarf with a mass of 0.362+/-0.022 Msolar and is expected to be ~6.4 mag fainter than the primary in K. The minimum mass of the putative planetary companion is Mpsini=1.43+/-0.13 MJup. Based on high-precision Hipparcos observations, we are able to place a dynamical upper limit on this mass of 13.3MJup at the 95% confidence level, and 16.9MJup at the 99.73% (3 sigma) confidence level, thus confirming that it is indeed substellar in nature. The orbit of this object is only 9.8 times smaller than the orbit of the secondary star (the smallest ratio among exoplanet host stars in multiple systems), but it is stable if coplanar with the binary.},

	Abstract = {Knowledge of the stellar parameters for the parent stars of transiting exoplanets is a prerequisite for establishing the planet properties themselves, and often relies on stellar evolution models. GJ 436, which is orbited by a transiting Neptune-mass object, presents a difficult case because it is an M dwarf. Stellar models in this mass regime are not as reliable as for higher mass stars, and tend to underestimate the radius. Here we use constraints from published transit light curve solutions for GJ 436 along with other spectroscopic quantities to show how the models can still be used to infer the mass and radius accurately, and at the same time allow the radius discrepancy to be estimated. Similar systems should be found during the upcoming Kepler mission, and could provide in this way valuable constraints to stellar evolution models in the lower main sequence. The stellar mass and radius of GJ 436 are M*=0.452+0.014-0.012 Msolar and R*=0.464+0.009-0.011 Rsolar, and the radius is 10% larger than predicted by the standard models, in agreement with previous results from well-studied double-lined eclipsing binaries. We obtain an improved planet mass and radius of Mp=23.17+/-0.79 M⊕ and Rp=4.22+0.09-0.10 R⊕, a density of rhop=1.69+0.14-0.12 g cm-3, and an orbital semimajor axis of a=0.02872+/-0.00027 AU.},

	Abstract = {For many decades the determination of accurate fundamental parameters for stars (masses, radii, temperatures, luminosities, etc.) has mostly been the domain of eclipsing binary systems. That has begun to change as long-baseline interferometric techniques have improved significantly, and powerful new instruments have come online. This paper will review the status of the field, and in particular how the knowledge of precise stellar properties helps us understand stars. Main-sequence stars similar to the Sun are by far the best studied, but much remains to be done for other kinds of objects such as early-type as well as late-type stars including brown dwarfs, evolved stars, metal-poor stars, and pre-main sequence stars. Progress is illustrated with several examples of how interferometry has contributed significantly in some of these areas.},

	Abstract = {We reexamine the photometric and spectroscopic evidence available for the star OGLE-TR-56, recently discovered to harbor a giant planet presenting transits and orbiting with a period of 1.21 days. We investigate the possibility that the observational signatures reported might be the result of ``blending'' with the light of an eclipsing binary along the same line of sight. Using techniques developed earlier we perform fits to the light curve under a variety of blend configurations, subject to all observational constraints, and we infer further properties of these possible blends. We then carry out realistic end-to-end simulations based on those properties in order to quantify the spectral line asymmetries and radial velocity variations expected from such scenarios. We confront these calculations with the observations. The results from these models are clearly inconsistent with the measured radial velocity and bisector span variations, ruling out blends and confirming the planetary nature of the companion. The example of OGLE-TR-56 serves to illustrate the sort of tests that can and should be performed on transiting planet candidates to eliminate the possibility of ``false positives'' and, in particular, line-of-sight contamination from eclipsing binaries.},

@article{Torres:2004,
	Abstract = {We report high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up observations of the faint transiting planet candidate OGLE-TR-33 (V=14.7), located in the direction of the Galactic center. Small changes in the radial velocity of the star were detected that initially suggested the presence of a large planet or brown dwarf in orbit. However, further analysis revealed spectral line asymmetries that change in phase with the 1.95 day period, casting doubt on those measurements. These asymmetries make it more likely that the transit-like events in the light curve are the result of contamination from the light of an eclipsing binary along the same line of sight (referred to as a ``blend''). We performed detailed simulations in which we generated synthetic light curves resulting from such blend scenarios and fitted them to the measured light curve. Guided by these fits and the inferred properties of the stars, we uncovered a second set of lines in our spectra that correspond to the primary of the eclipsing binary and explain the asymmetries. Using all the constraints from spectroscopy, we were then able to construct a model that satisfies all the observations and to characterize the three stars based on model isochrones. OGLE-TR-33 is fully consistent with being a hierarchical triple system composed of a slightly evolved F6 star (the brighter object) near the end of its main-sequence phase and an eclipsing binary with a K7-M0 star orbiting an F4 star. The application to OGLE-TR-33 of the formalism developed to fit light curves of transit candidates illustrates the power of such simulations for predicting additional properties of the blend and for guiding further observations that may serve to confirm that scenario, thereby ruling out a planet. Tests such as this can be very important for validating faint candidates.},

	Abstract = {The field of exoplanet research has revitalized interest in M dwarfs, which have become favorite targets of Doppler and transit surveys. Accurate measurements of their basic properties such as masses, radii, and effective temperatures have revealed significant disagreements with predictions from stellar evolution theory in the sense that stars are larger and cooler than expected. These anomalies are believed to be due to high levels of activity in these stars. The evidence for the radius discrepancies has grown over the years as more and more determinations have become available; however, fewer of these studies include accurate determinations of the temperatures. The ubiquitous mass-radius diagrams featured in many new discovery papers are becoming more confusing due to increased scatter, which may be due in part to larger than realized systematic errors affecting many of the published measurements. A discussion of these and other issues is given here from an observer's perspective, along with a summary of theoretical efforts to explain the radius and temperature anomalies.},

	Abstract = {We report homogeneous spectroscopic determinations of the effective temperature, metallicity, and projected rotational velocity for the host stars of 56 transiting planets. Our analysis is based primarily on the stellar parameter classification (SPC) technique. We investigate systematic errors by examining subsets of the data with two other methods that have often been used in previous studies (Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME) and MOOG). The SPC and SME results, both based on comparisons between synthetic spectra and actual spectra, show strong correlations between T eff, [Fe/H], and log g when solving for all three quantities simultaneously. In contrast the MOOG results, based on a more traditional curve-of-growth approach, show no such correlations. To combat the correlations and improve the accuracy of the temperatures and metallicities, we repeat the SPC analysis with a constraint on log g based on the mean stellar density that can be derived from the analysis of the transit light curves. Previous studies that have not taken advantage of this constraint have been subject to systematic errors in the stellar masses and radii of up to 20% and 10%, respectively, which can be larger than other observational uncertainties, and which also cause systematic errors in the planetary mass and radius.},

	Abstract = {Light curves from the Kepler Mission contain valuable information on the nature of the phenomena producing the transit-like signals. To assist in exploring the possibility that they are due to an astrophysical false positive, we describe a procedure (BLENDER) to model the photometry in terms of a "blend" rather than a planet orbiting a star. A blend may consist of a background or foreground eclipsing binary (or star-planet pair) whose eclipses are attenuated by the light of the candidate and possibly other stars within the photometric aperture. We apply BLENDER to the case of Kepler-9 (KIC 3323887), a target harboring two previously confirmed Saturn-size planets (Kepler-9 b and Kepler-9 c) showing transit timing variations, and an additional shallower signal with a 1.59 day period suggesting the presence of a super-Earth-size planet. Using BLENDER together with constraints from other follow-up observations we are able to rule out all blends for the two deeper signals and provide independent validation of their planetary nature. For the shallower signal, we rule out a large fraction of the false positives that might mimic the transits. The false alarm rate for remaining blends depends in part (and inversely) on the unknown frequency of small-size planets. Based on several realistic estimates of this frequency, we conclude with very high confidence that this small signal is due to a super-Earth-size planet (Kepler-9 d) in a multiple system, rather than a false positive. The radius is determined to be 1.64+0.19 -0.14 R ⊕, and current spectroscopic observations are as yet insufficient to establish its mass.},

	Abstract = {This article presents and discusses a critical compilation of accurate, fundamental determinations of stellar masses and radii. We have identified 95 detached binary systems containing 190 stars (94 eclipsing systems, and alpha Centauri) that satisfy our criterion that the mass and radius of both stars be known within errors of $\pm$3% accuracy or better. All of them are non-interacting systems, and so the stars should have evolved as if they were single. This sample more than doubles that of the earlier similar review by Andersen (Astron Astrophys Rev 3:91-126, 1991), extends the mass range at both ends and, for the first time, includes an extragalactic binary. In every case, we have examined the original data and recomputed the stellar parameters with a consistent set of assumptions and physical constants. To these we add interstellar reddening, effective temperature, metal abundance, rotational velocity and apsidal motion determinations when available, and we compute a number of other physical parameters, notably luminosity and distance. These accurate physical parameters reveal the effects of stellar evolution with unprecedented clarity, and we discuss the use of the data in observational tests of stellar evolution models in some detail. Earlier findings of significant structural differences between moderately fast-rotating, mildly active stars and single stars, ascribed to the presence of strong magnetic and spot activity, are confirmed beyond doubt. We also show how the best data can be used to test prescriptions for the subtle interplay between convection, diffusion, and other non-classical effects in stellar models. The amount and quality of the data also allow us to analyse the tidal evolution of the systems in considerable depth, testing prescriptions of rotational synchronisation and orbital circularisation in greater detail than possible before. We show that the formulae for pseudo-synchronisation of stars in eccentric orbits predict the observed rotations quite well, except for very young and/or widely separated stars. Deviations do occur, however, especially for stars with convective envelopes. The superior data set finally demonstrates that apsidal motion rates as predicted from General Relativity plus tidal theory are in good agreement with the best observational data. No reliable binary data exist, which challenge General Relativity to any significant extent. The new data also enable us to derive empirical calibrations of M and R for single (post-) main-sequence stars above {0.6 M_{odot}}. Simple, polynomial functions of T eff, log g and [Fe/H] yield M and R within errors of 6 and 3%, respectively. Excellent agreement is found with independent determinations for host stars of transiting extrasolar planets, and good agreement with determinations of M and R from stellar models as constrained by trigonometric parallaxes and spectroscopic values of T eff and [Fe/H]. Finally, we list a set of 23 interferometric binaries with masses known to be better than 3%, but without fundamental radius determinations (except alpha Aur). We discuss the prospects for improving these and other stellar parameters in the near future.},

	Abstract = {With 40 or more transiting exoplanets now known, the time is ripe to seek patterns and correlations among their observed properties, which may give important insights into planet formation, structure, and evolution. This task is made difficult by the widely different methodologies that have been applied to measure their properties in individual cases. Furthermore, in many systems our knowledge of the planet properties is limited by the knowledge of the properties of the parent stars. To address these difficulties we have undertaken the first comprehensive analysis of the data for 23 transiting planets using a uniform methodology. We revisit several of the recently proposed correlations, and find new ones involving the metallicity of the parent stars.},

	Abstract = {Context. Mapping distant worlds is the next frontier for exoplanet infrared (IR) photometry studies. Ultimately, constraining spatial and temporal properties of an exoplanet atmosphere (e.g., its temperature) will provide further insight into its physics. For tidally-locked hot Jupiters that transit and are eclipsed by their host star, the first steps are now possible.  Aims: Our aim is to constrain an exoplanet's (1) shape, (2) brightness distribution (BD) and (3) system parameters from its phase curve and eclipse measurements. In particular, we rely on the secondary-eclipse scanning which is obtained while an exoplanet is gradually masked by its host star.  Methods: We use archived Spitzer/IRAC 8-mum data of HD 189733 (six transits, eight secondary eclipses, and a phase curve) in a global Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure for mitigating systematics. We also include HD 189733's out-of-transit radial velocity (RV) measurements to assess their incidence on the inferences obtained solely from the photometry.  Results: We find a 6sigma deviation from the expected occultation of a uniformly-bright disk. This deviation emerges mainly from a large-scale hot spot in HD 189733b's atmosphere, not from HD 189733b's shape. We indicate that the correlation of the exoplanet orbital eccentricity, e, and BD ("uniform time offset") does also depend on the stellar density, rho*, and the exoplanet impact parameter, b ("e-b-rho*-BD correlation"). For HD 189733b, we find that relaxing the eccentricity constraint and using more complex BDs lead to lower stellar/planetary densities and a more localized and latitudinally-shifted hot spot. We, therefore, show that the light curve of an exoplanet does not constrain uniquely its brightness peak localization. Finally, we obtain an improved constraint on the upper limit of HD 189733b's orbital eccentricity, e <= 0.011 (95% confidence), when including HD 189733's RV measurements.  Conclusions: Reanalysis of archived HD 189733's data constrains HD 189733b's shape and BD at 8 mum. Our study provides new insights into the analysis of exoplanet light curves and a proper framework for future eclipse-scanning observations. In particular, observations of the same exoplanet at different wavelengths could improve the constraints on HD 189733's system parameters while ultimately yielding a large-scale time-dependent 3D map of HD 189733b's atmosphere. Finally, we discuss the perspective of extending our method to observations in the visible (e.g., Kepler data), in particular to better understand exoplanet albedos.

	Abstract = {We recently reported the photometric and spectroscopic detection of the primary transit of the 111-day-period, eccentric extra-solar planet HD 80606b, at Observatoire de Haute-Provence, France. The whole egress of the primary transit and a section of its central part were observed, allowing the measurement of the planetary radius, and evidence for a spin-orbit misalignment through the observation of the Rossiter-McLaughlin anomaly. The ingress not having been observed for this long-duration transit, uncertainties remained in the parameters of the system. We present here a refined, combined analysis of our photometric and spectroscopic data, together with further published radial velocities, ground-based photometry, and Spitzer photometry around the secondary eclipse, as well as new photometric measurements of HD 80606 acquired at Mount Hopkins, Arizona, just before the beginning of the primary transit. Although the transit is not detected in those new data, they provide an upper limit for the transit duration, which narrows down the possible behaviour of the Rossiter-McLaughlin anomaly in the unobserved part of the transit. We analyse the whole data with a Bayesian approach using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo integration on all available information. We find Rp = 0.98 $\pm$ 0.03 {R}_Jup for the planetary radius, and a total primary transit duration of 11.9 $\pm$ 1.3 h from first to fourth contact. Our analysis reinforces the hypothesis of spin-orbit misalignment in this system (alignment excluded at >95% level), with a positive projected angle between the planetary orbital axis and the stellar rotation (median solution lambda ˜ 50$\,^{\circ}$). As HD 80606 is a component of a binary system, the peculiar orbit of its planet could result from a Kozai mechanism.  Based on observations made with the 1.20-m and 1.93-m telescopes at Observatoire de Haute-Provence (CNRS), France, by the SOPHIE consortium (program 07A.PNP.CONS), and with a 16-inch telescope at Mt. Hopkins, Arizona, USA, by the MEarth team.

	Abstract = {Most transiting planets orbit very close to their parent star, causing strong tidal forces between the two bodies. Tidal interaction can modify the dynamics of the system through orbital alignment, circularization, synchronization and orbital decay by exchange of angular moment. Evidence for tidal circularization in close-in giant planet is well known. Here, we review the evidence for excess rotation of the parent stars due to the pull of tidal forces towards spin-orbit synchronization. We find suggestive empirical evidence for such a process in the present sample of transiting planetary systems. The corresponding angular momentum exchange would imply that some planets have spiralled towards their star by substantial amounts since the dissipation of the protoplanetary disc. We suggest that this could quantitatively account for the observed mass-period relation of close-in gas giants. We discuss how this scenario can be further tested and point out some consequences for theoretical studies of tidal interactions and for the detection and confirmation of transiting planets from radial velocity and photometric surveys.},

	Abstract = {After the publication of this Letter, we discovered an important north-south degeneracy in the eclipse mapping technique. The planet's orbit is not perfectly edge-on, and we do not know whether its orbital angular momentum vector is tilted toward or away from us. We therefore do not know whether the planet's northern or southern regions are occulted first during ingress. Accounting for this degeneracy slightly strengthens our conclusion that the planet's hottest latitude is equatorial. We now find a hot spot latitude within 21fdg1 of the equator for the secondary eclipse inversion, albeit with a slight preference for off-equatorial locations, and within 10fdg1 of the equator for the eclipse plus phase-function inversion (68% confidence). Furthermore, one of the original figure captions confused ingress and egress. Following the standard convention that a planet's rotational angular momentum points north, the western regions of the planet are occulted first during ingress, and revealed first during egress.},

	Abstract = {We derive the first secondary eclipse map of an exoplanet, HD 189733b, based on Spitzer IRAC 8 mum data. We develop two complementary techniques for deriving the two-dimensional planet intensity: regularized slice mapping and spherical harmonic mapping. Both techniques give similar derived intensity maps for the infrared dayside flux of the planet, while the spherical harmonic method can be extended to include phase variation data which better constrain the map. The longitudinal offset of the dayside hot spot is consistent with that found in prior studies, strengthening the claim of super-rotating winds, and eliminating the possibility of phase variations being caused by stellar variability. The latitude of the hot spot is within 12fdg5 (68% confidence) of the planet's equator, confirming the predictions of general circulation models for hot Jupiters and indicative of a small planet obliquity.},

	Abstract = {We present observations of six transits and six eclipses of the transiting planet system HD 189733 taken with the Spitzer Space Telescope's Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) at 8 mum, as well as a re-analysis of previously published data. We use several novel techniques in our data analysis, the most important of which is a new correction for the detector "ramp" variation with a double-exponential function, which performs better and is a better physical model for this detector variation. Our main scientific findings are (1) an upper limit on the variability of the dayside planet flux of 2.7% (68% confidence); (2) the most precise set of transit times measured for a transiting planet, with an average accuracy of 3 s; (3) a lack of transit-timing variations, excluding the presence of second planets in this system above 20% of the mass of Mars in low-order mean-motion resonance at 95% confidence; (4) a confirmation of the planet's phase variation, finding the night side is 64% as bright as the day side, as well as an upper limit on the nightside variability of 17% (68% confidence); (5) a better correction for stellar variability at 8 mum causing the phase function to peak 3.5 hr before secondary eclipse, confirming that the advection and radiation timescales are comparable at the 8 mum photosphere; (6) variation in the depth of transit, which possibly implies variations in the surface brightness of the portion of the star occulted by the planet, posing a fundamental limit on non-simultaneous multi-wavelength transit absorption measurements of planet atmospheres; (7) a measurement of the infrared limb darkening of the star, which is in good agreement with stellar atmosphere models; (8) an offset in the times of secondary eclipse of 69 s, which is mostly accounted for by a 31 s light-travel time delay and 33 s delay due to the shift of ingress and egress by the planet hot spot; this confirms that the phase variation is due to an offset hot spot on the planet; (9) a retraction of the claimed eccentricity of this system due to the offset of secondary eclipse, which is now just an upper limit; and (10) high-precision measurements of the parameters of this system. These results were enabled by the exquisite photometric precision of Spitzer IRAC; for repeat observations the scatter is less than 0.35 mmag over the 590 day timescale of our observations after decorrelating with detector parameters.},

	Abstract = {We present the asteroseismic analysis of 1948 F-, G- and K-type main-sequence and subgiant stars observed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Kepler mission. We detect and characterize solar-like oscillations in 642 of these stars. This represents the largest cohort of main-sequence and subgiant solar-like oscillators observed to date. The photometric observations are analysed using the methods developed by nine independent research teams. The results are combined to validate the determined global asteroseismic parameters and calculate the relative precision by which the parameters can be obtained. We correlate the relative number of detected solar-like oscillators with stellar parameters from the Kepler Input Catalogue and find a deficiency for stars with effective temperatures in the range 5300 ≲Teff≲ 5700 K and a drop-off in detected oscillations in stars approaching the red edge of the classical instability strip. We compare the power-law relationships between the frequency of peak power, numax, the mean large frequency separation, Deltanu, and the maximum mode amplitude, Amax, and show that there are significant method-dependent differences in the results obtained. This illustrates the need for multiple complementary analysis methods to be used to assess the robustness and reproducibility of results derived from global asteroseismic parameters.},

@article{Guillot:2010,
	Abstract = {Context. The evolution of stars and planets is mostly controlled by the properties of their atmosphere. This is particularly true in the case of exoplanets close to their stars, for which one has to account both for an (often intense) irradiation flux, and from an intrinsic flux responsible for the progressive loss of the inner planetary heat.  Aims: The goals of the present work are to help understanding the coupling between radiative transfer and advection in exoplanetary atmospheres and to provide constraints on the temperatures of the deep atmospheres. This is crucial in assessing whether modifying assumed opacity sources and/or heat transport may explain the inflated sizes of a significant number of giant exoplanets found so far.  Methods: I use a simple analytical approach inspired by Eddington's approximation for stellar atmospheres to derive a relation between temperature and optical depth valid for plane-parallel static grey atmospheres which are both transporting an intrinsic heat flux and receiving an outer radiation flux. The model is parameterized as a function of mean visible and thermal opacities, respectively.  Results: The model is shown to reproduce relatively well temperature profiles obtained from more sophisticated radiative transfer calculations of exoplanetary atmospheres. It naturally explains why a temperature inversion (stratosphere) appears when the opacity in the optical becomes significant compared to that in the infrared. I further show that the mean equivalent flux (proportional to T4) is conserved in the presence of horizontal advection on constant optical depth levels. This implies with these hypotheses that the deep atmospheric temperature used as outer boundary for the evolution models should be calculated from models pertaining to the entire planetary atmosphere, not from ones that are relevant to the day side or to the substellar point. In these conditions, present-day models yield deep temperatures that are ~1000 K too cold to explain the present size of planet HD 209458b. An tenfold increase in the infrared to visible opacity ratio would be required to slow the planetary cooling and contraction sufficiently to explain its size. However, the mean equivalent flux is not conserved anymore in the presence of opacity variations, or in the case of non-radiative vertical transport of energy: The presence of clouds on the night side or a downward transport of kinetic energy and its dissipation at deep levels would help making the deep atmosphere hotter and may explain the inflated sizes of giant exoplanets.},
